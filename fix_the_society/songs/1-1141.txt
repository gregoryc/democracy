Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
