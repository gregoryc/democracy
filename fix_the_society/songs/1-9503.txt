Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
