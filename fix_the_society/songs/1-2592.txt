Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
