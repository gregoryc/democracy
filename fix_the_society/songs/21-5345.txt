Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
