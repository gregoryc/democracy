Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
