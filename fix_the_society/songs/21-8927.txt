Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
