Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
