Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
