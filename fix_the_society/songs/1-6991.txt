Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
