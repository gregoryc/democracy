Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
