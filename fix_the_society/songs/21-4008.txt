Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
