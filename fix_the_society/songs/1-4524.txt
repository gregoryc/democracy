Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
