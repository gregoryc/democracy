Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
