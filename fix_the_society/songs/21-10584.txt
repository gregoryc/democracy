Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
