Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
