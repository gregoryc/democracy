Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
