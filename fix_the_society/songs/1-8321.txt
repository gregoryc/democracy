Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
