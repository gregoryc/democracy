Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
