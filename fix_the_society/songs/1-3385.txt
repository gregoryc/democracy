Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
