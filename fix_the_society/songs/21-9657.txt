Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
