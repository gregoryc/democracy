Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
