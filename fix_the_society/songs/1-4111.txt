Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
