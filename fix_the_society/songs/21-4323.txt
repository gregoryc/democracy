Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
