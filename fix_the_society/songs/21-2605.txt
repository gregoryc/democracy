Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
