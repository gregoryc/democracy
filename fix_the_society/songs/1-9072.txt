VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
