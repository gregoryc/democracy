Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
