Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
