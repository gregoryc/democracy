Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
