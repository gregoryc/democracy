Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
