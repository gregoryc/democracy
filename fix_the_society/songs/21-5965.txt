Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
