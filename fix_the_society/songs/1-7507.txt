Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
