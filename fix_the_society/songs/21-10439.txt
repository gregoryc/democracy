Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
