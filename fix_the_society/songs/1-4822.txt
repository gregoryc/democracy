Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
