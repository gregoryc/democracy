Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
