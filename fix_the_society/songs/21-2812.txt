Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
