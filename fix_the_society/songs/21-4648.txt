Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
