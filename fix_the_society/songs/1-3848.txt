Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Science is  fundamentally inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
