Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
