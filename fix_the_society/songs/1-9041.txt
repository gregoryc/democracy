Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
