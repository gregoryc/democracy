VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
