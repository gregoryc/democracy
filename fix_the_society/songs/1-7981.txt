Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
