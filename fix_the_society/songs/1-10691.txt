Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
