Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
