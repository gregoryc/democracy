Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
