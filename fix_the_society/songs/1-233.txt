Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
