Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Not talking isn't going to divert
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
