Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
