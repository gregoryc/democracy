VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
