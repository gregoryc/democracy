Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
