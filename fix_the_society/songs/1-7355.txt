Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
