Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
