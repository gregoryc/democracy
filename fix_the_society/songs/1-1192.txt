Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
