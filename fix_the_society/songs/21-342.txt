Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
