Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
