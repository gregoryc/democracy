Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
