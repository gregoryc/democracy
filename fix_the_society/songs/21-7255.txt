Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
