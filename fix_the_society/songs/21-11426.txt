Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
