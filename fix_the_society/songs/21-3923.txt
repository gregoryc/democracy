Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
