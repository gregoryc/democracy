Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
