Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
