Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
