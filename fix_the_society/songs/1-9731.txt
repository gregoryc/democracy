Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
