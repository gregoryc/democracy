Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
