Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
