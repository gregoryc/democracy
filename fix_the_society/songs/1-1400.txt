Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
