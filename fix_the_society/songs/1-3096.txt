Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
