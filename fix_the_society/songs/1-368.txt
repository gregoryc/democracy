Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Not talking isn't going to divert
The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
