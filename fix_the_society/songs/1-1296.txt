Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS
