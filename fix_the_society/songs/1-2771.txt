Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
