Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
