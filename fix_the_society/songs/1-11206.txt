Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
