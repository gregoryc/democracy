Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
