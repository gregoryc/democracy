Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
