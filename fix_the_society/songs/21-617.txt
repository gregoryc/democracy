Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
