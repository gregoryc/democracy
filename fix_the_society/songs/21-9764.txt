Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
