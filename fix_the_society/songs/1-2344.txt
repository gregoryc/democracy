Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
