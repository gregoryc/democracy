Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
