Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
