Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid
