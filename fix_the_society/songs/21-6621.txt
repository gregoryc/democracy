Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
