Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
