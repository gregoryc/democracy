Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
