Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
