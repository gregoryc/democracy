Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Science is  fundamentally inert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
