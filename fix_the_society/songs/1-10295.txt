Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
