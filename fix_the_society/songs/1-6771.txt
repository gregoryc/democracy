Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
