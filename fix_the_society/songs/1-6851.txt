Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
