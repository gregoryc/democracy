Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
