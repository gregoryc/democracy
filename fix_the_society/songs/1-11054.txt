Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Whining and crying like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
