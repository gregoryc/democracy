Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
