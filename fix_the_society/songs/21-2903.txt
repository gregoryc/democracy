Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
