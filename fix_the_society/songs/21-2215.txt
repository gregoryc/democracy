Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
