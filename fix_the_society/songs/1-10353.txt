Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
