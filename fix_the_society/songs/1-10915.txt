Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
