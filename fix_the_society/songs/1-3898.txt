Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
