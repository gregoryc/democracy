Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
