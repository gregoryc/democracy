Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
