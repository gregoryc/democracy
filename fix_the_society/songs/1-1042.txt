Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
