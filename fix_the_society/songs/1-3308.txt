Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
