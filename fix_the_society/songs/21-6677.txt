Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
