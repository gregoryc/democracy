Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
