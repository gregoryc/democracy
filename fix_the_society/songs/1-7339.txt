Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
