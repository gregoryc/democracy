Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
