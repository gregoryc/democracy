Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
