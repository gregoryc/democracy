Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
