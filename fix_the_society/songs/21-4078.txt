Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
