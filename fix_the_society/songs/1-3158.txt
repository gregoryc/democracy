Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
