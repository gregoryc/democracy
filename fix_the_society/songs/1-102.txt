Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
