Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
