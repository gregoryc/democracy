Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid

Their minds, they cannot exert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid

Their minds, they cannot exert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid

Their minds, they cannot exert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
