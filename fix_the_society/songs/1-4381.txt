Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
