Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
