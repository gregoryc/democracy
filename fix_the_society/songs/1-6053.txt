Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
