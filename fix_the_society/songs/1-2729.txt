Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
