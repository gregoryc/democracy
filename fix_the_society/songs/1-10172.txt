Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
No one will be unhurt

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
