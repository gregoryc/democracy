Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
