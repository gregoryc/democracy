Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
