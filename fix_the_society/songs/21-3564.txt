Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
