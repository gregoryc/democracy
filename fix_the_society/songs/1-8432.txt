Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
