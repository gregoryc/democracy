VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
