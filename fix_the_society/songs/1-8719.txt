Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
