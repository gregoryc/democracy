Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
