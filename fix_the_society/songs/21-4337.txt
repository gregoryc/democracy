Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
