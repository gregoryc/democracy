Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
