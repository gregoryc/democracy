Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
