Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
