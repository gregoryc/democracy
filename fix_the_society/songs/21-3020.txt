Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
