Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
