Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
