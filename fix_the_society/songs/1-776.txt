Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
