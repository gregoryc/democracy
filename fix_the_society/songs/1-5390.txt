Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
