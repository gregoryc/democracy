Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
