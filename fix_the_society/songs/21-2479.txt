Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
