Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
