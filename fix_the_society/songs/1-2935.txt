Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They do junk, they do dirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
