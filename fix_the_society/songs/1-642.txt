Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
I must speak here, I must interject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
