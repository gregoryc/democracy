Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS
