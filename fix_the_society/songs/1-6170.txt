Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
