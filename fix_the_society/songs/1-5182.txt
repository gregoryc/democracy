Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
