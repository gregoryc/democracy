Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
