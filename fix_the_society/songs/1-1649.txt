Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
