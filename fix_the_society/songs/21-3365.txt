Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
