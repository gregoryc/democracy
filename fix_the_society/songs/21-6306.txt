Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
