Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
