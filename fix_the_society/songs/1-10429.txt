Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
