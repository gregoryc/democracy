Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
