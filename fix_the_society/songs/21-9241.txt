Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
