Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
