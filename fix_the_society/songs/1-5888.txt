Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
