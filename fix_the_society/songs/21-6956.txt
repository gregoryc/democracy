Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
