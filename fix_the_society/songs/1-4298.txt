Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
