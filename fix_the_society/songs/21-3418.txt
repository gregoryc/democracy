Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
