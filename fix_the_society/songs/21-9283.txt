Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
