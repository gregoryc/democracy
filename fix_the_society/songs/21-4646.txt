Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
