Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
