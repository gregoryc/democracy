Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
