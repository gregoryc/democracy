Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
