Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
