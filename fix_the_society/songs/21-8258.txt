Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
