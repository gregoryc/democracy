Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
