Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
