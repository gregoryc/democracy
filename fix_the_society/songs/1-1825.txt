Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
