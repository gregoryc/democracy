Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
