Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
