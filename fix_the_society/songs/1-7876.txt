Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Science is  fundamentally inert

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Science is  fundamentally inert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
