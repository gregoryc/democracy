VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
