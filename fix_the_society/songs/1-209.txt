Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

This is plain, anyone can detect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

This is plain, anyone can detect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

This is plain, anyone can detect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
