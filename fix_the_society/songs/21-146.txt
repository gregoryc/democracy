Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
