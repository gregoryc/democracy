Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
