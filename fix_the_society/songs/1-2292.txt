Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
