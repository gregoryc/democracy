Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
