Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
