Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
