Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
