Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
