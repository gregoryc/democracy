Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
