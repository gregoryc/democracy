Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
