Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
