Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
