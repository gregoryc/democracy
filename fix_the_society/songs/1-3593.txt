Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
