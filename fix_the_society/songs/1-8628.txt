Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
