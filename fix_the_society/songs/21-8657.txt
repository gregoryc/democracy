Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
