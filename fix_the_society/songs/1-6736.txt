Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
