Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
