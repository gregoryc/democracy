Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
