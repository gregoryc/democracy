Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
