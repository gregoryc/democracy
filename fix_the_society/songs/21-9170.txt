Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
