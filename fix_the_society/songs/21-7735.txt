Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
