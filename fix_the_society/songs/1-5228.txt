Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
