Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
