Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
