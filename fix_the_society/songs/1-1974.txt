Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
