Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
