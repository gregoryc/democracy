Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
