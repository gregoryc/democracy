Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
