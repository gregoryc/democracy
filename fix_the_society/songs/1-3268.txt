VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
