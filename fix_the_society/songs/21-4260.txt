Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
