Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
