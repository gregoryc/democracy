Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
