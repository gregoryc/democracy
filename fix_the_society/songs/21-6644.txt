Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
