Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
An open conversation, they always divert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
An open conversation, they always divert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
