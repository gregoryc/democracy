Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
