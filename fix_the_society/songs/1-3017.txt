Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
