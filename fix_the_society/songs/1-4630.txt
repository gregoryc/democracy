Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The state of science is, wholly inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
