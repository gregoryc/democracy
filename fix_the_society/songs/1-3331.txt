Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
