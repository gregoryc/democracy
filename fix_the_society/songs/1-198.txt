VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
