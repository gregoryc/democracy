Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
