Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
