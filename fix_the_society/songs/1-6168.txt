Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
