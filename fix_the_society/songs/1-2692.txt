Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
