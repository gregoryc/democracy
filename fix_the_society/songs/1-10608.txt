Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
