Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
I must speak here, I must interject

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
