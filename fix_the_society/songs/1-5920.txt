Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
