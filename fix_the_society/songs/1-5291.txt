Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
