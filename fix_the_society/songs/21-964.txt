Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
