Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
