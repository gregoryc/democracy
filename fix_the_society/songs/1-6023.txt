VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their own principles are something they do not respect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
