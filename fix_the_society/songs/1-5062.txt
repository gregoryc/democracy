Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
I must speak here, I must interject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
