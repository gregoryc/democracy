Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
