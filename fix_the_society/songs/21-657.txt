Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
