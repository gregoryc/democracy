Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
