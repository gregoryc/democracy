Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
