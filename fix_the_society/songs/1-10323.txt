Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Playing only the worst card
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
