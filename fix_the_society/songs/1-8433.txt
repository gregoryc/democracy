VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
