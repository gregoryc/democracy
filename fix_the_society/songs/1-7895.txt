Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
