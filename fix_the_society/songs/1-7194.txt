Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
