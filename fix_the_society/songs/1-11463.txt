Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
