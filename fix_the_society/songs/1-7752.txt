Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
