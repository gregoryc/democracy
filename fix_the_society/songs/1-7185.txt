Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
