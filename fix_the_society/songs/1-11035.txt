Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
