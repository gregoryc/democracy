Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is too insidious for many to detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
