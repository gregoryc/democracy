Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
