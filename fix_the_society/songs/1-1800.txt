Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
