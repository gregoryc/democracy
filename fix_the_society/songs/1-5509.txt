Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Science is  fundamentally inert

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
