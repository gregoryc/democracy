Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
