Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
