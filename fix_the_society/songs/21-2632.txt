Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
