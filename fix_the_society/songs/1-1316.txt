Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
