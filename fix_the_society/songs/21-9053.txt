Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
