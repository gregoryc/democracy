Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
