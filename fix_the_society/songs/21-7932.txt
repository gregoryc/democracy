Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
