Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
