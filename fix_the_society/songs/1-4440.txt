Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
