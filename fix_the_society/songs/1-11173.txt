Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Reason is what they want to discard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
