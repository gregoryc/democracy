Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
