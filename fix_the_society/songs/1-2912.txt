Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
