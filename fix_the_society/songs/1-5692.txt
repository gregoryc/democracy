Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
