Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
