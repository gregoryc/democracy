Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
