Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
