Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
