Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
