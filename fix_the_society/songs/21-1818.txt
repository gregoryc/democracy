Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
