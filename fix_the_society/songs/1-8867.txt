Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
