Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
