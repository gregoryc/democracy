Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
