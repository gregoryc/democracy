Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
