Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
