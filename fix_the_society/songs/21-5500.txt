Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
