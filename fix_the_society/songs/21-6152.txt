Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
