Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
