Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
