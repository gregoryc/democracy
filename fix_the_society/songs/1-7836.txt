Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
