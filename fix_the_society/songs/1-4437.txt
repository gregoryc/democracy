Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
