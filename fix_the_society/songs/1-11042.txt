Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is plain, anyone can detect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
