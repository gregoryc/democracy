VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
