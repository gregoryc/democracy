Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
