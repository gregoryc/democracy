Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
