Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
