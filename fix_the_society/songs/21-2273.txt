Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
