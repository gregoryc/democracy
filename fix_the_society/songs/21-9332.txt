Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
