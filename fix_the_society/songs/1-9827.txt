VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
