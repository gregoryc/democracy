Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
