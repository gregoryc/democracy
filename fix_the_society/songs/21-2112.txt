Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
