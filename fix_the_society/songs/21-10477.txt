Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
