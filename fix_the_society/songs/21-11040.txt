Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
