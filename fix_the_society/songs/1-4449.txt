VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All with their clique, eating their dessert

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
