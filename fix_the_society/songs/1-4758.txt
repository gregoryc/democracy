Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
