Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
