Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
