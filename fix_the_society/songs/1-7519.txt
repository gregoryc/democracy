Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
