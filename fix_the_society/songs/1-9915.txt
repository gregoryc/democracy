VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
