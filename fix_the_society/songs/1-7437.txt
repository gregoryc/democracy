Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
