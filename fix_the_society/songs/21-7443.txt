Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
