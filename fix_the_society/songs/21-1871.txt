Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
