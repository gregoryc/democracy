VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
