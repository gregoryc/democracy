VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
