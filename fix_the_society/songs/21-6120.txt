Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
