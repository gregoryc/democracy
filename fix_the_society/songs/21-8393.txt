Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
