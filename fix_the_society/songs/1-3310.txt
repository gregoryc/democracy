Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
