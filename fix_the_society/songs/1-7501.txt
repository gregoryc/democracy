Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
