Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
