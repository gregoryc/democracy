Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
