Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
