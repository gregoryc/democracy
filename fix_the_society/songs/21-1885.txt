Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
