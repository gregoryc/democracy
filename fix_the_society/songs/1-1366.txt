VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
