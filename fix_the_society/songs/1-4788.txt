Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
