Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
