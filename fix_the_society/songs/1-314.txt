Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
