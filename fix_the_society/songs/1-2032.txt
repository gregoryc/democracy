Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
