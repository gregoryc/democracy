Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
