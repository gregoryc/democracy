Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
