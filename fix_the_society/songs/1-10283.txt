Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
