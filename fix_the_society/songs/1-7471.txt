VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
