Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
