Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
