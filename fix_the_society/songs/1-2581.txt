Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
