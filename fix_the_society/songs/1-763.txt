Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
