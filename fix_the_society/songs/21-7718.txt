Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
