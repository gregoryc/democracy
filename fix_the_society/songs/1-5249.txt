VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
