Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
