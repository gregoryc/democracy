Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
