Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
