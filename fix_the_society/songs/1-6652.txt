Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
