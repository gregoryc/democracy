Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
