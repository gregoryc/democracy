Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
