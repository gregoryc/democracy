Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
