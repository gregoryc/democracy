Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Reason is what they want to discard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
