Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
