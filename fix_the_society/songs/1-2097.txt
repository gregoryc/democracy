Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
