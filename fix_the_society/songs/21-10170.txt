Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
