Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
