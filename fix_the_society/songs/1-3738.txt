Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
