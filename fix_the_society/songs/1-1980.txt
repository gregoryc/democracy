Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
