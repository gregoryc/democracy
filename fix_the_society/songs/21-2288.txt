Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
