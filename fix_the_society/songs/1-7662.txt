Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
