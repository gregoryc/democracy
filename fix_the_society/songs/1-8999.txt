Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
