Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The state of science is, wholly inert

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
