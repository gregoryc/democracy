Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
