Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
