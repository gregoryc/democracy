Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
