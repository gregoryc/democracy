Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
