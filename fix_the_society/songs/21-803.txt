Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
