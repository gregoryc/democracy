Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Science is  fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Science is  fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
