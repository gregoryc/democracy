Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
