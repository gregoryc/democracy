Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
