Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
