Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
