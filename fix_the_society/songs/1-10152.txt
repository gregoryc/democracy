Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
