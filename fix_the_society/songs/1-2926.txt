Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
