Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
