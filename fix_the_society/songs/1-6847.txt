Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
