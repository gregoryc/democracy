Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
