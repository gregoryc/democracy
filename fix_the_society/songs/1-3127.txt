Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
