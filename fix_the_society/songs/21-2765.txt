Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
