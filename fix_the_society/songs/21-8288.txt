Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
