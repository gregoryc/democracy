Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
