Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
