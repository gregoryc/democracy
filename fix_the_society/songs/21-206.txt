Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
