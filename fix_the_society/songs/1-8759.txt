Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too insidious for many to detect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
