Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
