Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
