Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
