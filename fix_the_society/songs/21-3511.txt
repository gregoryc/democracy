Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
