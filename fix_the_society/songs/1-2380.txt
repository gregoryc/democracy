Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
