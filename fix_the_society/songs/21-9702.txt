Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
