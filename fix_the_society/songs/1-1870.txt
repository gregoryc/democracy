VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
