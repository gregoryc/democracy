Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
