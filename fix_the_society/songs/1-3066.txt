Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
