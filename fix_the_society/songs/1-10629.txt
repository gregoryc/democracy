Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
