Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
