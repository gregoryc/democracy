Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
