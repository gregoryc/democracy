Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
