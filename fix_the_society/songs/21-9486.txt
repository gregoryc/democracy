Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
