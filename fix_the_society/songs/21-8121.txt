Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
