Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS
