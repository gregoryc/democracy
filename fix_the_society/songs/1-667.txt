Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
