Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
