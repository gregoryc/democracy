Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
