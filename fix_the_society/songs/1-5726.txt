Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
