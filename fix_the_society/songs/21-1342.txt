Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
