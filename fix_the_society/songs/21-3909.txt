Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
