Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
