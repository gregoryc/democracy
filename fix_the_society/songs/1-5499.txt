Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
