Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
