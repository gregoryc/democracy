Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
