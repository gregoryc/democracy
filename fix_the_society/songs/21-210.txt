Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
