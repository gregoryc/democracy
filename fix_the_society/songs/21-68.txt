Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
