Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
