Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
