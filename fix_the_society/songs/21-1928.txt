Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
