Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
