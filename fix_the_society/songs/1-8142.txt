Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
