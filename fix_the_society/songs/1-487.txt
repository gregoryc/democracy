Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
I must speak here, I must interject
