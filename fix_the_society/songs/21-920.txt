Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
