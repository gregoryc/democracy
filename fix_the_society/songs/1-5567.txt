Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
