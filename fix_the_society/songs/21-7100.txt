Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
