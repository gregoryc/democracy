Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
I must speak here, I must interject

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
