Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Whining and complaining like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
