Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
