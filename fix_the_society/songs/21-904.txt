Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
