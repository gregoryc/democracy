Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
