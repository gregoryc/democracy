Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
