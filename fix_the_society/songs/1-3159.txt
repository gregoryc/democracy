Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
