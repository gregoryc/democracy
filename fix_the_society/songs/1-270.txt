Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
