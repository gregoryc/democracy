Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
