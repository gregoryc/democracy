Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
