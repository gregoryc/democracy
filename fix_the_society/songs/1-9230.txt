VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
