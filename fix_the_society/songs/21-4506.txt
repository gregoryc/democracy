Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
