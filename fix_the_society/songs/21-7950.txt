Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
