Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
