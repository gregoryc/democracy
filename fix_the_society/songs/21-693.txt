Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
