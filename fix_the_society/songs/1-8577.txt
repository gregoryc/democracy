Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
