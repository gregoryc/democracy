Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
