Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
