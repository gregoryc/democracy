Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
