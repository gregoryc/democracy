Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
