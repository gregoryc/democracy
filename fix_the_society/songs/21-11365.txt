Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
