Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
