Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
