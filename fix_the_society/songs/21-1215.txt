Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
