Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
