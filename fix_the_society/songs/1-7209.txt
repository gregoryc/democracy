Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
