Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Science is  fundamentally inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Science is  fundamentally inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
