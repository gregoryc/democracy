Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
