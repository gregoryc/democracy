Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
