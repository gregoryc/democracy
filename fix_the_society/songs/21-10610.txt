Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
