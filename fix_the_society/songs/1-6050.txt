Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
