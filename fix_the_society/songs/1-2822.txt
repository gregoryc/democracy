Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
