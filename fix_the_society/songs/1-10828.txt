Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is plain, anyone can detect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
