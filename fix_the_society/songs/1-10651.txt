Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
