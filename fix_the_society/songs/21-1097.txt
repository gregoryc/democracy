Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
