Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
