Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
