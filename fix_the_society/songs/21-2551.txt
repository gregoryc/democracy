Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
