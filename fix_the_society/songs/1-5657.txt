Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
