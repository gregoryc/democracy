Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
