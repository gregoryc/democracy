Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
