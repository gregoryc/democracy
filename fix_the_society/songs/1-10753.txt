Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
