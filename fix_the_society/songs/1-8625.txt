Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
