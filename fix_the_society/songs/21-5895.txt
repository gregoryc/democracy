Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
