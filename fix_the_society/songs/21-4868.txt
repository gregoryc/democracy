Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
