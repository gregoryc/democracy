Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
