Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
