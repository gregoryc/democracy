Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
