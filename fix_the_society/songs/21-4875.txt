Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
