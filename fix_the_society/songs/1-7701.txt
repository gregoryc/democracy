Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
