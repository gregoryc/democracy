Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
