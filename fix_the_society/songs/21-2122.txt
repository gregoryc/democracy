Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
