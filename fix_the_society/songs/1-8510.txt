VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
