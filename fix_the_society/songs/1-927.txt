Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
