Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
