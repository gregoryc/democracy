Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
