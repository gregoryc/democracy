Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
