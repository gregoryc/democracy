Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
