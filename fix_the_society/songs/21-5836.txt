Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
