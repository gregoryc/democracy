Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
No one will be unhurt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
