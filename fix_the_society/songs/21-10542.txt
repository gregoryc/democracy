Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
