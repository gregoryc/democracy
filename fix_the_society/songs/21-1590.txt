Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
