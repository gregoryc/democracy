Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
