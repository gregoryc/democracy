VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their own principles are something they do not respect

This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
