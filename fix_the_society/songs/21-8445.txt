Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
