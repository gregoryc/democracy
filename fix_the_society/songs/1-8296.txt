Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
