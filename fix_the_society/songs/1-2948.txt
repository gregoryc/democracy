Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
