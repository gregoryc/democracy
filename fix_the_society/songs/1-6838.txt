Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
