Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
