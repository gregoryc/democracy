Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
