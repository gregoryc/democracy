Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
