Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
