Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
