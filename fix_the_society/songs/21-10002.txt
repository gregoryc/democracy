Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
