Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
