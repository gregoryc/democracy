Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
