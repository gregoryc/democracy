Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
