Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
