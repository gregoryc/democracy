Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
