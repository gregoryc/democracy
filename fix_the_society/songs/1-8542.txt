Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
