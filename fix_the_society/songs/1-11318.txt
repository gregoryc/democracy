Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and crying like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and crying like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
