Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
