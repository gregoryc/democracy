Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
