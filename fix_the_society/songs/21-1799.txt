Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
