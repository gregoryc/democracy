Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
