Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
