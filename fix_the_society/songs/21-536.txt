Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
