Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
