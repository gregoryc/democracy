Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
