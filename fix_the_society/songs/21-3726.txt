Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
