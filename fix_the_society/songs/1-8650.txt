Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
