Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
