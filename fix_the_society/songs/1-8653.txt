Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
