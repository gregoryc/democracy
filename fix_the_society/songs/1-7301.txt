Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
