Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
