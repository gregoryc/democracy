Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
