Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
