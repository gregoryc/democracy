Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
