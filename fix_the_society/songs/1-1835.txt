Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
