Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
