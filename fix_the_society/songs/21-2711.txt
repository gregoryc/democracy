Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
