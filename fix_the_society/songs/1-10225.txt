Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too insidious for many to detect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too insidious for many to detect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
