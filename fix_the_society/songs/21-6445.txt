Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
