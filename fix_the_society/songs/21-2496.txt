Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
