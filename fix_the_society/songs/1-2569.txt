Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
