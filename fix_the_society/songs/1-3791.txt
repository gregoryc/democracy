Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
