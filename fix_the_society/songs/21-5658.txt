Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
