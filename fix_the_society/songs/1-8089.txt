Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
