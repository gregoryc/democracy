Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
