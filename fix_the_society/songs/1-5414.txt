Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
