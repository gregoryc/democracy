Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
