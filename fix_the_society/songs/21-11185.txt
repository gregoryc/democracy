Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
