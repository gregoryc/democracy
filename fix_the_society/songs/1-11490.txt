Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
