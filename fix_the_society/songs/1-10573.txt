Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
