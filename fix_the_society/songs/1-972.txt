Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
