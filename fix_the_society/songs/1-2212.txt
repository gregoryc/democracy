Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
