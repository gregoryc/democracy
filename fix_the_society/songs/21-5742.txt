Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
