Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
