Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
