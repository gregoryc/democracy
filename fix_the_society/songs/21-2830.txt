Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
