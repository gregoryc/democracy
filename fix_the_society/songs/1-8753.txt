Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
I must speak here, I must interject

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
