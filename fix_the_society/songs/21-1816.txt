Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
