Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
