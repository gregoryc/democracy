Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
