Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
