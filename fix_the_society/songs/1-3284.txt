Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
