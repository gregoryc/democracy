Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
