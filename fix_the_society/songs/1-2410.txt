Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
