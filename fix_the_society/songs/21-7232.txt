Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
