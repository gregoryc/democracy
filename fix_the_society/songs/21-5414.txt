Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
