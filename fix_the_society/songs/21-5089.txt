Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
