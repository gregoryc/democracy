Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
