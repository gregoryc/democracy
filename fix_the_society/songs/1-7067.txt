Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
