Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
