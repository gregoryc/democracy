Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
