Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
