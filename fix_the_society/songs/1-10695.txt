Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
