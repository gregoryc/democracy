Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
