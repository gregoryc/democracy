Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
