Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
