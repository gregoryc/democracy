VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
