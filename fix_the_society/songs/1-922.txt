Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
