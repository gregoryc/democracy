Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
