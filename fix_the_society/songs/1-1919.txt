Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
