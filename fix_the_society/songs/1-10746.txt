Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
