Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
