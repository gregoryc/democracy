Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
