Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
