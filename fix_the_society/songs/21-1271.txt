Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
