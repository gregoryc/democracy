Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
