Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
