VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Hiding away, just like in a cave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
