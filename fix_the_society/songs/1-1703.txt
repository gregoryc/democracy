Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
