Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
