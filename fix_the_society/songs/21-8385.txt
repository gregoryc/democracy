Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
