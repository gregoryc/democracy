Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too insidious for many to detect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
