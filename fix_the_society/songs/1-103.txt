Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
