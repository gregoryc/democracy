Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
