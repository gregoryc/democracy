Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
