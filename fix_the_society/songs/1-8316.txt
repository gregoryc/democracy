Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
