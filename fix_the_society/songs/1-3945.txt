Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
