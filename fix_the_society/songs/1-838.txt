VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
