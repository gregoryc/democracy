Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
