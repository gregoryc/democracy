Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
