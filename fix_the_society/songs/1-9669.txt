Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
