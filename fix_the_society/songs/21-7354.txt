Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
