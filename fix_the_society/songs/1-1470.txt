Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, they act like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
