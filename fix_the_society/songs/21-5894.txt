Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
