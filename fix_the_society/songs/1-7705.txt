Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
