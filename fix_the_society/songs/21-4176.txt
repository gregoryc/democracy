Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
