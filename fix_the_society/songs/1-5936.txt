Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
