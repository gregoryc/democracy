Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
