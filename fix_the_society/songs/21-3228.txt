Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
