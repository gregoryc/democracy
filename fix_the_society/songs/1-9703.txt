Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
