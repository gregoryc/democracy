Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
