Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
