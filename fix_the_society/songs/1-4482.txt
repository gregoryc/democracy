Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
