Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
