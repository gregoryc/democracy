Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
