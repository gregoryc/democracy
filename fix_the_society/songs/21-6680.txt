Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
