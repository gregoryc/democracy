Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
