Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
