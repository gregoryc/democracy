Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
