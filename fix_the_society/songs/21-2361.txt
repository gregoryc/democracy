Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
