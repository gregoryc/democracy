Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
