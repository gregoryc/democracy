Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
