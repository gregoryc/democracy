Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
