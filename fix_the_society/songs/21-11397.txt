Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
