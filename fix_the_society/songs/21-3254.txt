Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
