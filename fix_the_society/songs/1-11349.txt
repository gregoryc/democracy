Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
