Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
