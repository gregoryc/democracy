VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
