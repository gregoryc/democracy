Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
