Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
