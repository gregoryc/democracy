Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
