Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
