Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
