Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
