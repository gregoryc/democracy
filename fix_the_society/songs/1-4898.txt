Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
