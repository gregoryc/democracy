Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
