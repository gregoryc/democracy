Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
