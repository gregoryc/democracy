Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
