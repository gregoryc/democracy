Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
