Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
