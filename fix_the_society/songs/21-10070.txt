Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
