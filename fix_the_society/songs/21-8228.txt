Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
