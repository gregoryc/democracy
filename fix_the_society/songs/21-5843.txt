Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
