Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
