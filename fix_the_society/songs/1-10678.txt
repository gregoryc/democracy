Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
