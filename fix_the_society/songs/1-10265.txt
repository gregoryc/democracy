Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
