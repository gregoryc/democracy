Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
