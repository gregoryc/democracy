Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
