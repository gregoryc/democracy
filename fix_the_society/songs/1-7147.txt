Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
