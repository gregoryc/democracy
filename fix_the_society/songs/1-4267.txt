Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
