Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

I must speak here, I must interject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
