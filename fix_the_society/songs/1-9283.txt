Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
