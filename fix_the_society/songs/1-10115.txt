Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
