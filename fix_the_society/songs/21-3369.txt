Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
