Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
