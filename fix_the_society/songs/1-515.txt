Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
