Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
