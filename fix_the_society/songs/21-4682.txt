Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
