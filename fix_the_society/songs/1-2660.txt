Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
