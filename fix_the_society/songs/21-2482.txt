Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
