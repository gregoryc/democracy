Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
