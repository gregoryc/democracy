Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
