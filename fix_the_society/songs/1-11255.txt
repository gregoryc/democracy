Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
