Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
