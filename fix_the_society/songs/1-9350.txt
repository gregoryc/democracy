Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
