Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
