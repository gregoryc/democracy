Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
