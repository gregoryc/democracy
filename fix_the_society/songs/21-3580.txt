Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
