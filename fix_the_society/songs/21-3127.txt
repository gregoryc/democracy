Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
