Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
