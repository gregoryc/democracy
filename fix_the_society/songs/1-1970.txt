Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
