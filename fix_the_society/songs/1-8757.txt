Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
