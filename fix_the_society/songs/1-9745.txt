Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
