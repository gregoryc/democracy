Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
