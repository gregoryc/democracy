Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
