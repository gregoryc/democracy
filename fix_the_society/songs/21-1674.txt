Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
