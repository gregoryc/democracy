Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
