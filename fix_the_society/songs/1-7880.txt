Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
