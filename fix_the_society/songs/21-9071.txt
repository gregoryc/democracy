Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
