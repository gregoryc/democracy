Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
