VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
