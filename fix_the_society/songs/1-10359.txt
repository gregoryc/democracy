Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Playing only the worst card
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Playing only the worst card
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
