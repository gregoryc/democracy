Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
