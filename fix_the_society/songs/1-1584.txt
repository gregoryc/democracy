Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
