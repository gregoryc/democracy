Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
