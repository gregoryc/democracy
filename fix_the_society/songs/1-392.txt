Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

They hate themselves, they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

I must speak here, I must interject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

They hate themselves, they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
