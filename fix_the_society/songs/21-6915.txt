Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
