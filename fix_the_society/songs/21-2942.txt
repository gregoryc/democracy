Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
