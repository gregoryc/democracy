Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
