Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
