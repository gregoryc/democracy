Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
