Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
