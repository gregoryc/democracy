Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
