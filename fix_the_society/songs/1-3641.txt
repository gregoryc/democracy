Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
