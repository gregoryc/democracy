Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
