Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
