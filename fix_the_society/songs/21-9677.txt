Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
