Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
