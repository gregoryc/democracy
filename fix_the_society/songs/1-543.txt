Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
