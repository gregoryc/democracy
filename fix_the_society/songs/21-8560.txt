Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
