Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
