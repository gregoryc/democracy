Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
