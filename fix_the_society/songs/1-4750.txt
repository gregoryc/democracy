VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
