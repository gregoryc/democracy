Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
