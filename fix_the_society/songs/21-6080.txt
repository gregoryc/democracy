Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
