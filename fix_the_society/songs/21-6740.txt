Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
