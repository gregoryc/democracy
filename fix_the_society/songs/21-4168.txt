Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
