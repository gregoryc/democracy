Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
