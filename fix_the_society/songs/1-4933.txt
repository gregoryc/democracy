Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
