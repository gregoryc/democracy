Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is too insidious for many to detect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
