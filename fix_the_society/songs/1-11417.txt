VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and crying like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
