Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
