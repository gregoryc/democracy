Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
