Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
