Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
