Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
