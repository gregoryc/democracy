Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
