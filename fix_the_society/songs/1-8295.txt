Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
