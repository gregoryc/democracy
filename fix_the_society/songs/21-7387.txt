Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
