Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
