Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
