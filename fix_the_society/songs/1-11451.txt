Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
