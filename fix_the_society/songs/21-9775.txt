Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
