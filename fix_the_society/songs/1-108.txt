Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They hate themselves, they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
