Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
