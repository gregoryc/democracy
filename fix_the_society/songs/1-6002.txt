Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS
