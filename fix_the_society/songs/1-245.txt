Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
