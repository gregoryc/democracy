Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
