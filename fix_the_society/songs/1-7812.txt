Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
