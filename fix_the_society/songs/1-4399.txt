Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
