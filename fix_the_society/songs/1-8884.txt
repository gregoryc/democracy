Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
