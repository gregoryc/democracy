Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
