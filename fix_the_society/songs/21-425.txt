Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
