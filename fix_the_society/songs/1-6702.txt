Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
