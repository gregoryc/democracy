Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
