VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
