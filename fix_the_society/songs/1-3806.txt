Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
