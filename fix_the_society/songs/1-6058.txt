Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
