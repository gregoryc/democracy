Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
