Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
