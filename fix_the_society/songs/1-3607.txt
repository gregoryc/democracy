Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
