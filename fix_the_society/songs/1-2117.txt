Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
