VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
