Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
