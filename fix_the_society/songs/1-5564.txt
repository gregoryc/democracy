Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
