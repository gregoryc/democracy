Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
