Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
