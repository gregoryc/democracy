Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
