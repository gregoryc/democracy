Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
