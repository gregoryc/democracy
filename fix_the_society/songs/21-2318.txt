Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
