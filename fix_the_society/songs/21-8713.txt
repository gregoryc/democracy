Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
