Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
