Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
