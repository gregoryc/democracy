Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
