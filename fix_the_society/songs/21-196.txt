Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
