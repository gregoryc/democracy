Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
