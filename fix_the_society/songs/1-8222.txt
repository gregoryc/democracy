Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, they act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
