VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

VERSE

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
