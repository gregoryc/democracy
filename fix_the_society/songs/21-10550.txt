Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
