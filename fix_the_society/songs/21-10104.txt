Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
