Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
