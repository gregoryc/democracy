Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
