Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
