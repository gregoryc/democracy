Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
