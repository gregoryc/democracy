Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
