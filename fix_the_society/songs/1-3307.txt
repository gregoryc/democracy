Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't think, they act like a kid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
