Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
