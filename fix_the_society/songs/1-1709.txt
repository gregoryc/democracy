Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
