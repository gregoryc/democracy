Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
