Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
