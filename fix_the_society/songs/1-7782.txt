Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
