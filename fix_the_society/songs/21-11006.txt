Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
