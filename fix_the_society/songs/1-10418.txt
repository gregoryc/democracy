Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
