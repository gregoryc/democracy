Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
