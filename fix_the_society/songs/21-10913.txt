Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
