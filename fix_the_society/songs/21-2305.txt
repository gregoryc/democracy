Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
