Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
