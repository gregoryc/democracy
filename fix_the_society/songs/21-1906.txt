Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
