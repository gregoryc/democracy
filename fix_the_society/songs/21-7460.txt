Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
