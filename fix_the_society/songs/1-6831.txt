Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
