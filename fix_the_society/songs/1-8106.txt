Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
