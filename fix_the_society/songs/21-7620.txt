Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
