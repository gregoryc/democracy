Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
