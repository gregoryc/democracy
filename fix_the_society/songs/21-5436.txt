Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
