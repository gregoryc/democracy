Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
