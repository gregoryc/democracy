Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
