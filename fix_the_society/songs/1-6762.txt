Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
