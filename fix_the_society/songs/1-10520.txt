Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
