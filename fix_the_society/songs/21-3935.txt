Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
