Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
