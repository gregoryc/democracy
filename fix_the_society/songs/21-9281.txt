Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
