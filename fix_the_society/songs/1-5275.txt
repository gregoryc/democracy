Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
