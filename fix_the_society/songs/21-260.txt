Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
