Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
