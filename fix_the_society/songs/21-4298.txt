Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
