VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
