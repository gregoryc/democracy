Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
