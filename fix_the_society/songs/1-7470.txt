Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
