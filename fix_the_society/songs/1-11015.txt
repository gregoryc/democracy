Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
