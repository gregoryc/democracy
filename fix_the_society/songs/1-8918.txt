Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
