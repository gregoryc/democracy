Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
