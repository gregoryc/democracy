VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

The society itself, you completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
