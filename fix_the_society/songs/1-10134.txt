VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
