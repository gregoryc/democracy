Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

This is too insidious for many to detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
