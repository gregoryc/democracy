Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
