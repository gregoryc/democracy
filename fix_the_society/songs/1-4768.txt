Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
