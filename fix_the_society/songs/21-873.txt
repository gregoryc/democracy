Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
