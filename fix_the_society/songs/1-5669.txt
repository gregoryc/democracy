Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
