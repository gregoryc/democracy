Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
