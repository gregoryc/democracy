Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
