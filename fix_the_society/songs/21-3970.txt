Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
