Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
