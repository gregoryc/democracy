Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
