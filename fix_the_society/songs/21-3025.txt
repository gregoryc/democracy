Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
