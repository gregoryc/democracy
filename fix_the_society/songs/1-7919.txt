Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
