VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

They do junk, they do dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
