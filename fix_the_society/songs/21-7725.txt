Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
