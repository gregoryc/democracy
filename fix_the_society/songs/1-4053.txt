Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
