Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
