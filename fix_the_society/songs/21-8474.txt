Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
