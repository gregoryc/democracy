Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
