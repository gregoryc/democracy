Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
