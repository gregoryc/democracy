Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
