Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
