Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
