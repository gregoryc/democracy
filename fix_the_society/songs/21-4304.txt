Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
