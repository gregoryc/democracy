Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
