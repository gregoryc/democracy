Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Evading conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
