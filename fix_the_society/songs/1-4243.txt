Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
