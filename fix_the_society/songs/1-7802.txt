Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
