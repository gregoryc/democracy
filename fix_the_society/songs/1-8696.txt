Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
