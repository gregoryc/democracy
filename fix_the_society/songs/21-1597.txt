Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
