Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
