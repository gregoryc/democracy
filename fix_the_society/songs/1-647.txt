Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
