Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
