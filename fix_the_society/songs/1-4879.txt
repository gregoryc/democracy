Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
