Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
