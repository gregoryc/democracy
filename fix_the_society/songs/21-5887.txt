Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
