Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
