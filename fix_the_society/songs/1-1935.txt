Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
