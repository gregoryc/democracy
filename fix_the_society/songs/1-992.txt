Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
