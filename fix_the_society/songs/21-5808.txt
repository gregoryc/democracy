Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
