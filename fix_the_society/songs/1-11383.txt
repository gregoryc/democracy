Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
