Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
