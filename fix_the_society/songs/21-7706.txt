Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
