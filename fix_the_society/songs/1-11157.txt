Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and moaning like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
