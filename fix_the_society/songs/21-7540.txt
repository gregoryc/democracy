Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
