Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
