Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
