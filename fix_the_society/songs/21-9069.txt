Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
