Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Whining and crying like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
