Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
