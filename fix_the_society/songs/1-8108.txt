Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
