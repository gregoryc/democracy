Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
