Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
