Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
