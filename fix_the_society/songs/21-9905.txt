Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
