Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
