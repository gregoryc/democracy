Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
