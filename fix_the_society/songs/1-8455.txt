Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
