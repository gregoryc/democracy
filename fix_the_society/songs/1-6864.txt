Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt

This is too insidious for many to detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and complaining like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
