Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
