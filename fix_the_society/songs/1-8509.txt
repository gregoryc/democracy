VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
