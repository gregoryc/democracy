Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS
