Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
