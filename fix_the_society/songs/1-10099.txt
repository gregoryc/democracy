Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
