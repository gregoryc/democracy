Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
