Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
