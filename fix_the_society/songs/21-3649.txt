Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
