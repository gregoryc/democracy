Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too insidious for many to detect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
