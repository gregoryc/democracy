Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
