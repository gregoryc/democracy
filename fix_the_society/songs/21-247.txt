Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
