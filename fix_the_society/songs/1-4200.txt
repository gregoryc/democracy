Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
