Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
