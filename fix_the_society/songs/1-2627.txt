Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
