Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
