Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
