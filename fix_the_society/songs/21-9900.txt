Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
