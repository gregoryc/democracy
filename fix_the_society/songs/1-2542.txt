Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
