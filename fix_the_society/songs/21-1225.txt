Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
