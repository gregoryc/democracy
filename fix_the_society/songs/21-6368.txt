Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
