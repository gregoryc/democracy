Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
