VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is plain, anyone can detect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is plain, anyone can detect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is plain, anyone can detect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
