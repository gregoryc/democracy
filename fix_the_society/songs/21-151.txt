Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
