Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
