Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
