Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
