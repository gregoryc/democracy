VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
