Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
