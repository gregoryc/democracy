Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
