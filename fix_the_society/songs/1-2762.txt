Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
