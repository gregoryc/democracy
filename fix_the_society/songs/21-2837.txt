Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
