Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
