Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
