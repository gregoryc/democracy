Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
