Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
