Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
