Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
