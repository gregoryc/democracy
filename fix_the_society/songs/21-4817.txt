Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
