Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
