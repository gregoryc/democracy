Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
