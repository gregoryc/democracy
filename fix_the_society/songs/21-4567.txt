Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
