Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
