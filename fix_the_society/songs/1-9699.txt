Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is  fundamentally inert

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
