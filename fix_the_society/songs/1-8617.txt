Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
