Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
