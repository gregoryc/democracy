Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
