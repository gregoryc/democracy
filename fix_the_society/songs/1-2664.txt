Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
