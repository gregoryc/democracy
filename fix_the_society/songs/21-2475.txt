Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
