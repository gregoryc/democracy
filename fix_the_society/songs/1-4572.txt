Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too insidious for many to detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
