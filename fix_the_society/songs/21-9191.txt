Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
