Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
