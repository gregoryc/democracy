Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Reason is what they want to discard

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Whining and crying like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
