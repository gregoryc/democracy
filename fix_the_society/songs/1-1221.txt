Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
