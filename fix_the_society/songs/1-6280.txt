Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
I must speak here, I must interject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
