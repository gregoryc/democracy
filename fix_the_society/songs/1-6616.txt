Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
