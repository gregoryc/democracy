Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
