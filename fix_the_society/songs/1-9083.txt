Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
