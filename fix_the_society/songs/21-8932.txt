Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
