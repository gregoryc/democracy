Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
