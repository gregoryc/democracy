Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
