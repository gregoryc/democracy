Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
