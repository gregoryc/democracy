Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
