Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
