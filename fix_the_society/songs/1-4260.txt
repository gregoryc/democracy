Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

An open conversation, they always divert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
