Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
