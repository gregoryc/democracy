Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
