Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
