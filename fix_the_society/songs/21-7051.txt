Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
