Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior makes them charred

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
