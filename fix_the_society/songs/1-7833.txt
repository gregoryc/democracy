VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
