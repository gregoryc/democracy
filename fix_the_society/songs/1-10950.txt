Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
