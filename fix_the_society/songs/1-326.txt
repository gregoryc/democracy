Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Away from the truth they hid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Away from the truth they hid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
