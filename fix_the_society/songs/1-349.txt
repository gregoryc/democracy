Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
