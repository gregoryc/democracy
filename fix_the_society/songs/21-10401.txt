Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
