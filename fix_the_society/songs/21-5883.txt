Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
