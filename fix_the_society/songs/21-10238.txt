Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
