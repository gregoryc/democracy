VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
