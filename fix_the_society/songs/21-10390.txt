Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
