Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
