Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
