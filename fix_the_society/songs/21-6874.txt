Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
