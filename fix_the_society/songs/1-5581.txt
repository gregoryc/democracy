VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
