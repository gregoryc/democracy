Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
