Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
