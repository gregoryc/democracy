Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
