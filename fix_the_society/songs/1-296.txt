Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
