Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
