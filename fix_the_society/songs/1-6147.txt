Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
