Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
