Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
