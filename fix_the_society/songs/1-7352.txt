Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
