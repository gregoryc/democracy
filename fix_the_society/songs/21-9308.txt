Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
