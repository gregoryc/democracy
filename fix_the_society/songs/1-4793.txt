Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
