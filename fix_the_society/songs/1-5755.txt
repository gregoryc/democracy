Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
