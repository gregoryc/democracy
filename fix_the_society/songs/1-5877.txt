Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
