Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is obvious, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This is obvious, anyone can detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
