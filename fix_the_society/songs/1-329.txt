Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
