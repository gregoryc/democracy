Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
