Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
