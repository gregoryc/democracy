Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
