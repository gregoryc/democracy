Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
