Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
