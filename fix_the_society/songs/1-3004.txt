Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
