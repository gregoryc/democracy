Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
