Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
