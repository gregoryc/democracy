VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
