VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
