Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
