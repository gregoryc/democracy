Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
