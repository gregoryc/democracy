Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
