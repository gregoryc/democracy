Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
