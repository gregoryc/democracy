Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
