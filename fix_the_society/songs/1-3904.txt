VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
