Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Science is  fundamentally inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
