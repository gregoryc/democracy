Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
