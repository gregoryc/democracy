Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Playing only the worst card

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
