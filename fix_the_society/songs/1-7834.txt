Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
