Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
