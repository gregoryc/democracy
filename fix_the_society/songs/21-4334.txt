Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
