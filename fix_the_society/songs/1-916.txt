VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
