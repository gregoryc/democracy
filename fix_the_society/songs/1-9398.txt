Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
