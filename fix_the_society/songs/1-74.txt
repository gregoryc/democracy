Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
I must speak here, I must interject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
