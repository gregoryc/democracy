Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
