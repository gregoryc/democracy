Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
