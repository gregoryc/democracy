Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
