VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
