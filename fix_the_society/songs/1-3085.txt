Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
