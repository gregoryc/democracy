Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
