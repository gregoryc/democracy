Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
