Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
