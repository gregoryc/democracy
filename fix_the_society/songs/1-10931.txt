VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
