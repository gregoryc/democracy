Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
