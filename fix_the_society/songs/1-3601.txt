Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
