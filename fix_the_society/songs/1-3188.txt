Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
