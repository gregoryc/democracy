VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
