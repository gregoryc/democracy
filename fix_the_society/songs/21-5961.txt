Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
