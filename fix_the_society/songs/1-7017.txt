Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
