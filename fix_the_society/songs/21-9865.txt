Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
