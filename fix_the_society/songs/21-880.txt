Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
