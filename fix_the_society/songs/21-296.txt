Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
