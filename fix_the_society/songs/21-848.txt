Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
