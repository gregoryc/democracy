Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
