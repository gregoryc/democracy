Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
