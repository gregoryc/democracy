Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
