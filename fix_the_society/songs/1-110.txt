Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
