Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
