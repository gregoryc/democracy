Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
