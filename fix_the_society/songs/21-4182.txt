Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
