Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
