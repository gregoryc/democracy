VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
