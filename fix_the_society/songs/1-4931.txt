Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
