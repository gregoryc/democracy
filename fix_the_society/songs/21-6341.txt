Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
