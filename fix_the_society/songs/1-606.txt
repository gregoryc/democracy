VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
