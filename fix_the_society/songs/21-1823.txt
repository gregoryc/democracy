Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
