Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
