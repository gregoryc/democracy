Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
