Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
