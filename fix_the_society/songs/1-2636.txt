Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
