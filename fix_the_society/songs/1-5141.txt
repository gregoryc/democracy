Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
