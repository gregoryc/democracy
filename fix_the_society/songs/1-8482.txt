Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
