Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
