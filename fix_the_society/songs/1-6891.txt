Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
