Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
