Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
