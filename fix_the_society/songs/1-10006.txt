Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
