VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They do junk, they do dirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Whining and moaning like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
