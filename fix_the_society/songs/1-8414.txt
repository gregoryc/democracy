Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
