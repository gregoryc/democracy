VERSE

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
