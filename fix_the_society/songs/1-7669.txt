Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
