Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
