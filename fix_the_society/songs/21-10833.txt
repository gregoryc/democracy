Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
