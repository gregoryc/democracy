Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
