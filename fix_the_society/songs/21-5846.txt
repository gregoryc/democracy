Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
