Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
