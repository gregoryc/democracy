Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
