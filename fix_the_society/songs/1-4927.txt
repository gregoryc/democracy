Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
