Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
