Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
