Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
