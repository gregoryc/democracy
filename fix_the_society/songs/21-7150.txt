Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
