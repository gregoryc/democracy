Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
