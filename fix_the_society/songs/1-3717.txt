Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
