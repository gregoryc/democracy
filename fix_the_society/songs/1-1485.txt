Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
