Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
