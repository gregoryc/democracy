Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
