Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
