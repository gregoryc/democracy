Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
