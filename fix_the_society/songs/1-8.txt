Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
