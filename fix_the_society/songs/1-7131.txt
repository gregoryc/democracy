Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
