Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
