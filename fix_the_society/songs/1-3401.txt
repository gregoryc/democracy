Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
