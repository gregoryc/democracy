Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
