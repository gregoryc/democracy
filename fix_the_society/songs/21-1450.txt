Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
