Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
