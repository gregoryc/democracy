Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
The state of science is, wholly inert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
