Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
