Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
