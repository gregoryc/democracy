Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
