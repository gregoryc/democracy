Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
