Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
