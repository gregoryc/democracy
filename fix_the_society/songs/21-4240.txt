Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
