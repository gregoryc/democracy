Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
