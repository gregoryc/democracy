Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

I must speak here, I must interject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
