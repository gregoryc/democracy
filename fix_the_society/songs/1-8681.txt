Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
