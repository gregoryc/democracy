Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
