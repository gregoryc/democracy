Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
