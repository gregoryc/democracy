Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
