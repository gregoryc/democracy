Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
