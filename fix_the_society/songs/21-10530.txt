Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
