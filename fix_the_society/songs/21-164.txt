Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
