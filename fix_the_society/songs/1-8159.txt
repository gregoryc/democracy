Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
