Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
