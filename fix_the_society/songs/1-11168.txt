VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

You don't think, they act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
