Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

This is too insidious for many to detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

This is too insidious for many to detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
