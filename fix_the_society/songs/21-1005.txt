Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
