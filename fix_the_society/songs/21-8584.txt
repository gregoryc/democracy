Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
