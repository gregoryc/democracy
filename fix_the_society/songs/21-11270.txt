Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
