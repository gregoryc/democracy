VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
