Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
