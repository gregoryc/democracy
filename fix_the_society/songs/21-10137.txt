Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
