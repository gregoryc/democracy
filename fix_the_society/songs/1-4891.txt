Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
