Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
