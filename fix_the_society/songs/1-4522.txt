Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
