Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
