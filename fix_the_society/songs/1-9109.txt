Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
