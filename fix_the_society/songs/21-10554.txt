Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
