Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
