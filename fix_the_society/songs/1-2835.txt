Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
