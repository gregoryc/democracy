Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
