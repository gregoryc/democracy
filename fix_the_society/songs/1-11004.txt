Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
