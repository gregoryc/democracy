Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
