Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
