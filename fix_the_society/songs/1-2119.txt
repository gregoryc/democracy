Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Whining and moaning like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
