Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
