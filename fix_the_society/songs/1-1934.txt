Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
