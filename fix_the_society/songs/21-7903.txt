Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
