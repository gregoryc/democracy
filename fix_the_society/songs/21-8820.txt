Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
