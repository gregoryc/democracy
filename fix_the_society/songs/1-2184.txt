Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
