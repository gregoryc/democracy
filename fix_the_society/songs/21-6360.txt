Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
