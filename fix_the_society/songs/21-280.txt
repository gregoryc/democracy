Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
