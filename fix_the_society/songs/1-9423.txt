Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

I must speak here, I must interject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

I must speak here, I must interject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
