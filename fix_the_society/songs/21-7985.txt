Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
