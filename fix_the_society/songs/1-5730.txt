Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Whining and crying like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
