Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
