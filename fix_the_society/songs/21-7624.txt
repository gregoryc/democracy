Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
