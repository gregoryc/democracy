Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
