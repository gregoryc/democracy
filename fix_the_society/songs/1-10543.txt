Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
