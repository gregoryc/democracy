Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
