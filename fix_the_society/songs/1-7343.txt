Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
