Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
