Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
