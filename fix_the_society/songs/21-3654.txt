Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
