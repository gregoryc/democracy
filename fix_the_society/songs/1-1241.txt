Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
