Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
