VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is plain, anyone can detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
