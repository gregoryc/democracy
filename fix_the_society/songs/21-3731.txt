Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
