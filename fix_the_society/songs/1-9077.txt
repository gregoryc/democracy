Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
