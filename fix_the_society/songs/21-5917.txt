Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
