Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
