Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
