Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
