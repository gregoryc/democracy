Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
