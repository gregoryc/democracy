Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
