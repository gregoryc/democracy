Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
