Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
