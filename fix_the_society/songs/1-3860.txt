Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS
