Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
