Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
