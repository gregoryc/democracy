Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
