Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, they act like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, they act like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, they act like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, they act like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
