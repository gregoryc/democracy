Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
