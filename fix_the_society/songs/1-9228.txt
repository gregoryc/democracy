Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
