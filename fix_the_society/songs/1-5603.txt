VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
