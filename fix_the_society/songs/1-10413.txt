Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
