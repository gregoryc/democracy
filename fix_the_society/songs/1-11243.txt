Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
