Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
