Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
