VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
