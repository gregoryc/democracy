Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
