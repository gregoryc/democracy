Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
