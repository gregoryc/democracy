Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
