Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
