Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
