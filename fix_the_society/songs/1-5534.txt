Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
