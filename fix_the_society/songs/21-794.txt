Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
