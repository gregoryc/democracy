Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and crying like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and crying like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
