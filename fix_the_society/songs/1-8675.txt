Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
If you talk to them they miss the subject

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
