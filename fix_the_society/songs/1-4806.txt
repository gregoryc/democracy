Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
