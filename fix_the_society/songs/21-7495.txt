Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
