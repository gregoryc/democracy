Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
