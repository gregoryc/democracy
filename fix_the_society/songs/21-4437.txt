Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
