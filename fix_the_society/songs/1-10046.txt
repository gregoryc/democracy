Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
