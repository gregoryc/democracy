Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
