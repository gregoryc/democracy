Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
