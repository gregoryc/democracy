Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
