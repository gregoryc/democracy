Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
