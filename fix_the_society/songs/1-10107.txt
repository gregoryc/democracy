Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
