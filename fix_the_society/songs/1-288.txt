Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
