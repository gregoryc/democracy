Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
