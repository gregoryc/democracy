Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
