Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
