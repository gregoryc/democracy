Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
