Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too insidious for many to detect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
