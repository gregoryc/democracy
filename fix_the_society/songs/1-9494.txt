Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
