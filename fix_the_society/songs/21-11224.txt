Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
