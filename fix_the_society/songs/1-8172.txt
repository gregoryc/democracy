Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
