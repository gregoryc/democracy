Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
