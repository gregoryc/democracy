Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
