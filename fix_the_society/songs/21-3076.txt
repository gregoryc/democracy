Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
