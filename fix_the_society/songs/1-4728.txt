Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
