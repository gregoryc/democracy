Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
