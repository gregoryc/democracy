Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
