VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They do junk, they do dirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
