Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
