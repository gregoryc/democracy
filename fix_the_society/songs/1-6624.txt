Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
