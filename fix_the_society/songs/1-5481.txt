Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
