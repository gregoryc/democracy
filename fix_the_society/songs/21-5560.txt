Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
