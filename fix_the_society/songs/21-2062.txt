Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
