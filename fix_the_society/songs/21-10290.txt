Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
