Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
