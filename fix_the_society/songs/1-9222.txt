Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
