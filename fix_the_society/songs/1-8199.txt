Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
