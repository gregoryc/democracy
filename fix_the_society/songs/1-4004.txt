VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
