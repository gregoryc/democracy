Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
