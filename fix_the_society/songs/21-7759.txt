Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
