Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
