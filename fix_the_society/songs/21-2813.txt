Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
