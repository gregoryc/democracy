Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
