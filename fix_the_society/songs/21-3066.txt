Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
