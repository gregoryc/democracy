Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
