Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
