Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
