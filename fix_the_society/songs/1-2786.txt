Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
