Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
