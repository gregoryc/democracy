Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
