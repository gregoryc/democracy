Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
