Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
