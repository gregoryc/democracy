Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
