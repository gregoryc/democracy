Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
