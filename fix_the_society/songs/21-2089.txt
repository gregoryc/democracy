Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
