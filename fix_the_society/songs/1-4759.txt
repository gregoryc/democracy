Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
