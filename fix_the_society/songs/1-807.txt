Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid

CHORUS

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
