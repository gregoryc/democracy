Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
