Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
