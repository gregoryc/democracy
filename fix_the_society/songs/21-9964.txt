Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
