VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and crying like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
