Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
