Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
