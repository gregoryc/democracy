Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
