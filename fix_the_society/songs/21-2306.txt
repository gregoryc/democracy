Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
