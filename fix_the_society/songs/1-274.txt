Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
