Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
