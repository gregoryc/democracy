Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
