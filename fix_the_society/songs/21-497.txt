Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
