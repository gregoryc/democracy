Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
