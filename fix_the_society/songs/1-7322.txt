Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
