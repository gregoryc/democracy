Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
