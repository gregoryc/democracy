Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is too insidious for many to detect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
