Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
