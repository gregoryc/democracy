Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt

The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
I must speak here, I must interject

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
