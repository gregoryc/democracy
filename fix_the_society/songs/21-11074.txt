Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
