Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
