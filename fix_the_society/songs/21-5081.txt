Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
