Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
