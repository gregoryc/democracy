Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
