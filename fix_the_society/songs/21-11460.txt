Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
