Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
