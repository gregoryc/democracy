Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
