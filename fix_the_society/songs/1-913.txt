Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
