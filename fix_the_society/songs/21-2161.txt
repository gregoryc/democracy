Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
