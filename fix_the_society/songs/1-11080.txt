Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
