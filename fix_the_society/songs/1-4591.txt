Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
