Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
