Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
