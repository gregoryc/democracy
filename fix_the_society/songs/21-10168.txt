Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
