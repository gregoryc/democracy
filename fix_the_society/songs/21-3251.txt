Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
