Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
