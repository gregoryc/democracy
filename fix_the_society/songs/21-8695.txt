Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
