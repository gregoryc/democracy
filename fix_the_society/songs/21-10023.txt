Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
