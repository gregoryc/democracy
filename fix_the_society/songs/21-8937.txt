Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
