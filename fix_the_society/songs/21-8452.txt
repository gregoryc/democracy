Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
