Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
