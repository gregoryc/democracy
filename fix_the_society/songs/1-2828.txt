Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
