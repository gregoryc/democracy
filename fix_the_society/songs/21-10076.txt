Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
