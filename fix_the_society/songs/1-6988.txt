Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
