Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
