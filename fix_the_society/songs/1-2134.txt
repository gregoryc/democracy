Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
