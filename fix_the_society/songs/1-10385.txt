Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
