Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
