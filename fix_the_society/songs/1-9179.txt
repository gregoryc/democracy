Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
