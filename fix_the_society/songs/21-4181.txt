Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
