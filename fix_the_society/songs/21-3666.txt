Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
