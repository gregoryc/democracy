Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
