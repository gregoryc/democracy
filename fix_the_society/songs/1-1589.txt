Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is  fundamentally inert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
