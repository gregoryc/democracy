Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
