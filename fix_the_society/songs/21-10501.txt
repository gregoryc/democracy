Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
