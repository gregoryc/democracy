Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
