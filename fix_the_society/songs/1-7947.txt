Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
