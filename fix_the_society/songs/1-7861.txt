Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
