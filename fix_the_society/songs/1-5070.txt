Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
