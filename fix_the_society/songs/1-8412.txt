VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
