Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
