Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
