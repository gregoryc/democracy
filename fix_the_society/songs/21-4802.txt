Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
