Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
