Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
