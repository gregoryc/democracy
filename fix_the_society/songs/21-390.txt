Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
