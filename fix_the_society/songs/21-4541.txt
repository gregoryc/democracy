Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
