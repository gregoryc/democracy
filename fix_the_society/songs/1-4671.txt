Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
