VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
