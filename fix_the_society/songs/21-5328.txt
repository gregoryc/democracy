Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
