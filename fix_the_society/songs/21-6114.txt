Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
