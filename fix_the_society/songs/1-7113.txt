Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
