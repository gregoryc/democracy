Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
