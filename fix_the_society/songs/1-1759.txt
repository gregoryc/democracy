VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
