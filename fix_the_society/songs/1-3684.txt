Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
