Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
