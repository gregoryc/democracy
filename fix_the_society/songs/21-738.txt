Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
