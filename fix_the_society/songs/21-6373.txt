Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
