Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
