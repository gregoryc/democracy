Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
