Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
