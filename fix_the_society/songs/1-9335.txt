Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
