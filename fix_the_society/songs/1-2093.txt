Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
