Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
