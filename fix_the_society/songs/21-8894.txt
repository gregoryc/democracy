Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
