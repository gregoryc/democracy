Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
