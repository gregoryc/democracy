VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
