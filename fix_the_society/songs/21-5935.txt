Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
