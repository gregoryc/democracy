Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
