Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
