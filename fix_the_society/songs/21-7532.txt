Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
