VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
