Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
