Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and moaning like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
