Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
