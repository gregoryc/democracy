Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
