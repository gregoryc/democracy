Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
