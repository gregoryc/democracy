Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
