Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
