Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
