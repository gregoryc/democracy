Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
