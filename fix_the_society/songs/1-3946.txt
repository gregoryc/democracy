Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
