Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
