Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Science is  fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
