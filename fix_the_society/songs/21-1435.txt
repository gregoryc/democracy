Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
