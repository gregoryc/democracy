Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
