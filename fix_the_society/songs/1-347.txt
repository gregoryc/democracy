Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too insidious for many to detect
I must speak here, I must interject
