Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
