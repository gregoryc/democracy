Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
