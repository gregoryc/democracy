Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
