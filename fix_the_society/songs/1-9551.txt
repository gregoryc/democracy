Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
