Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
