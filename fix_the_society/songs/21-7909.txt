Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
