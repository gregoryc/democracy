VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Science is  fundamentally inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
