Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
