VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
