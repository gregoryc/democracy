Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
