Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
