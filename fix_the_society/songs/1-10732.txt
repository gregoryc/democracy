Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
