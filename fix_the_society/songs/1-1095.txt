Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
