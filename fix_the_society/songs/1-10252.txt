Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
