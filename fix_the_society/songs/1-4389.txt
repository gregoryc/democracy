Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
