Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
