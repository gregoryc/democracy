Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
