Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
