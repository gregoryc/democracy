Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
