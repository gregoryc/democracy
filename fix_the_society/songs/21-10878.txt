Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
