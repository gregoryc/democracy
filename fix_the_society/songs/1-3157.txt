Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
