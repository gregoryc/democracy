Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
