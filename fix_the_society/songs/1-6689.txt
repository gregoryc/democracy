Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
