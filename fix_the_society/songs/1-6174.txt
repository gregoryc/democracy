Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
