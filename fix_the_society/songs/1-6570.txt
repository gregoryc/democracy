Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
