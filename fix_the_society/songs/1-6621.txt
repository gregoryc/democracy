Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
