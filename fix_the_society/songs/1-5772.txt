Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
