Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
