Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
