Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
