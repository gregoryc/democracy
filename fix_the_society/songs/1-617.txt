Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

This is too insidious for many to detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

This is too insidious for many to detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is too insidious for many to detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
