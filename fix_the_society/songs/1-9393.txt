Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
