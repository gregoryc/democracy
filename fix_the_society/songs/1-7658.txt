Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
