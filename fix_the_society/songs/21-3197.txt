Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
