Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
