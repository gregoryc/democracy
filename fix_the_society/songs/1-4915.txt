Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
