Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
