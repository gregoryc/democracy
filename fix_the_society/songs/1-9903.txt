Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
