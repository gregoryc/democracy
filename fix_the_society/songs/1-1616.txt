Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
