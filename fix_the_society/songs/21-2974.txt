Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
