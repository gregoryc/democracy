Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
