Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
