Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
