Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
