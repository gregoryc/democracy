Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
