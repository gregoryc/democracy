Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
