Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
