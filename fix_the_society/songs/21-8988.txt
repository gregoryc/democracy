Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
