Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
