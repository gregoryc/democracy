Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
