Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
