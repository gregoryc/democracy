Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
