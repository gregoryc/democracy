Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
