Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
