Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
