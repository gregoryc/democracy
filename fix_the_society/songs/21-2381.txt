Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
