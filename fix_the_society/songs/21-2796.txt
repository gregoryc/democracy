Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
