VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
