Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
