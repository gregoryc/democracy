Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
