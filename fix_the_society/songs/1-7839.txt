Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
