Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
