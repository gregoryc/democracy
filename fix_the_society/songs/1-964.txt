Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They don't think, they act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
