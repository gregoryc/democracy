Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
