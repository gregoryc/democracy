Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
