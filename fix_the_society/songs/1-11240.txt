Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
