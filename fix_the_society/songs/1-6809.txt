Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
