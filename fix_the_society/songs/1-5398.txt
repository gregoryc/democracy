Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
