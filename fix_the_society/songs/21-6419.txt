Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
