Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
