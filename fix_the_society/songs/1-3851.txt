Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
