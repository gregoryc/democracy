Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
