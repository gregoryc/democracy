Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
