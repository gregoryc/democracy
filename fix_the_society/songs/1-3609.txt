Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
