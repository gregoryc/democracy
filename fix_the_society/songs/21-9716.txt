Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
