Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
