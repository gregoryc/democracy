Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
