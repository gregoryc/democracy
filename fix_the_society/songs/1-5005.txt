Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
