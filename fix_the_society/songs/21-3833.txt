Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
