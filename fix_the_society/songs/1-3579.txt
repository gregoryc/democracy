Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
