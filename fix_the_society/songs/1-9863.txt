Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
