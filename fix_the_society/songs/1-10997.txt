Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
