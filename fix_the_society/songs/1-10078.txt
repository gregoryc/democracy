Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
