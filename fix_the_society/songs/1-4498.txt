VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
