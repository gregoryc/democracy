Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
