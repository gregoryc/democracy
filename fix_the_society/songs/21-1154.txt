Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
