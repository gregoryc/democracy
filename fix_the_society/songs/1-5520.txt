Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
