Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
