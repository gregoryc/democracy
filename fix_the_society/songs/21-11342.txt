Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
