Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
