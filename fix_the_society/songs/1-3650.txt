Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
