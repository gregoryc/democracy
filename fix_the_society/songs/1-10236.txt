Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
