Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
