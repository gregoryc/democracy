Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
