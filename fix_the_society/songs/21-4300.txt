Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
