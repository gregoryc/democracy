Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
