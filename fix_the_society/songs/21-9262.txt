Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
