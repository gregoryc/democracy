Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
