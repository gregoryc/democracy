Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
