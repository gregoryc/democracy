Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
