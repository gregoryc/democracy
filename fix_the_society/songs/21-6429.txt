Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
