Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
I must speak here, I must interject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
I must speak here, I must interject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
