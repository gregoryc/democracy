Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
