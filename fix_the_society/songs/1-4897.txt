Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
