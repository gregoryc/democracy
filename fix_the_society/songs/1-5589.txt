Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
