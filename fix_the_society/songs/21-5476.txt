Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
