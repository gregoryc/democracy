Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
