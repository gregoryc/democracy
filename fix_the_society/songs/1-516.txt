Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
