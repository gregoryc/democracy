Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They do junk, they do dirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
I must speak here, I must interject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They do junk, they do dirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
