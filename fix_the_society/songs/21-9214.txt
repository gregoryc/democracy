Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
