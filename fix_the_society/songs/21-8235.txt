Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
