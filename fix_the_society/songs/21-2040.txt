Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
