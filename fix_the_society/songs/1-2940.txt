Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
