Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
