Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
