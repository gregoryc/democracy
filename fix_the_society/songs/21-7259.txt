Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
