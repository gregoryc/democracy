Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
