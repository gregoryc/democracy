Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
