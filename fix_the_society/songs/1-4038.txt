Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
