Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
