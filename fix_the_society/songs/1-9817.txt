Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
