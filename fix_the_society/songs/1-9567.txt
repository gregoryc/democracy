Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
