Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
