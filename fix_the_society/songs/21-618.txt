Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
