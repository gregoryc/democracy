Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
