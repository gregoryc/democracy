Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
