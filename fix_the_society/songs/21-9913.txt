Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
