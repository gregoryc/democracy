Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
