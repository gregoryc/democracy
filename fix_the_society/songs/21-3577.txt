Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
