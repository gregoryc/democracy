Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
