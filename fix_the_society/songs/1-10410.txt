Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
