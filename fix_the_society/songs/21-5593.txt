Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
