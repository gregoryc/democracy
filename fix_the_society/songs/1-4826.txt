Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
