VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
