VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
