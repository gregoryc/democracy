Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
