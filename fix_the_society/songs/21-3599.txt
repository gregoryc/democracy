Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
