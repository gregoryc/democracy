Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
