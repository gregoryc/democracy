Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
