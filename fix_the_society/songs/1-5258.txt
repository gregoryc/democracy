Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
