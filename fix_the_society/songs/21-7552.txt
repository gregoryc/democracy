Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
