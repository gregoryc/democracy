Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
