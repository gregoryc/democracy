Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
