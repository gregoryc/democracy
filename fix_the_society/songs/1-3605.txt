Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
