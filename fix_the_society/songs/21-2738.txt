Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
