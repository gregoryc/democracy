Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
