Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
