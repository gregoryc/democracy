Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
