Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
