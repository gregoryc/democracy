Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
