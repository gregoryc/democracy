Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
