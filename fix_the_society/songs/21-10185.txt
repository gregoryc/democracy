Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
