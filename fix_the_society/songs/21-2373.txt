Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
