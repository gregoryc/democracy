Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
