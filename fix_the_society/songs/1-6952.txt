Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
