Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
