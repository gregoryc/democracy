Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
