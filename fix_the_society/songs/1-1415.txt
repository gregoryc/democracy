Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
