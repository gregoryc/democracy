Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
