Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
