Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
