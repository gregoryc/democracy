Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
