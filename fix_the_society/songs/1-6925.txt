VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

I must speak here, I must interject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Science is  fundamentally inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
