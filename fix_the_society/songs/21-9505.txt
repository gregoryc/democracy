Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
