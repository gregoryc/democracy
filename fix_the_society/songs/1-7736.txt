Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
