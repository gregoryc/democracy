Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
