Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
