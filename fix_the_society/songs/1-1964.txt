Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
