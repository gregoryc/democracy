Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
