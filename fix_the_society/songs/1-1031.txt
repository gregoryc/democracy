Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
