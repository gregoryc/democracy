Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
