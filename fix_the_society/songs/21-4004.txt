Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
