Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
