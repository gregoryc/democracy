Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
