Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
