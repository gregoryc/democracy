VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
