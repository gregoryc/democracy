Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
