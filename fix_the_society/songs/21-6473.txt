Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
