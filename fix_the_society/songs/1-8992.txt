Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
