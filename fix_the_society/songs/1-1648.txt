Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
