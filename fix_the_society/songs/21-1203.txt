Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
