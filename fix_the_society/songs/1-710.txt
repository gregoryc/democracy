Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
