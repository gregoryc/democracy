Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
