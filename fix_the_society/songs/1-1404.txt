Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't think, they act like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
