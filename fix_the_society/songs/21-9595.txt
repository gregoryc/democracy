Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
