Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
