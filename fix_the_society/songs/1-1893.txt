Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
