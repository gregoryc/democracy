Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
