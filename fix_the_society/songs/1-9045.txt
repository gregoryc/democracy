Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
