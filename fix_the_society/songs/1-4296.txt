Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
