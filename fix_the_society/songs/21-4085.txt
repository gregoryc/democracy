Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Protesting your problems will make you best

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
