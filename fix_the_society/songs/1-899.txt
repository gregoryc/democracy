Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
