Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
