Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
