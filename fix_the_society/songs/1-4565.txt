Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
