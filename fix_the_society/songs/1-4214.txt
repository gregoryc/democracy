Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
