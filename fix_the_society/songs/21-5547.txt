Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
