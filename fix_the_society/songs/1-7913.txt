Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
