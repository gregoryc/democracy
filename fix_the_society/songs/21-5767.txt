Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
