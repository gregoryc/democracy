Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
