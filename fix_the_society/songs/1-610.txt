Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
