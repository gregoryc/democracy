Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
