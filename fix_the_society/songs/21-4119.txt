Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
