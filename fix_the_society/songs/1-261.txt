Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
