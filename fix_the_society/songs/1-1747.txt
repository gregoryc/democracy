Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
