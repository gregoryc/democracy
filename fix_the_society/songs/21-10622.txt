Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
