Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
