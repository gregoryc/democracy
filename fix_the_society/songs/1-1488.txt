Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
