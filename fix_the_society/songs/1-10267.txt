Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
