Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
