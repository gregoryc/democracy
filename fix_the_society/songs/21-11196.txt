Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
