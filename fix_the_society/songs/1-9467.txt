Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
