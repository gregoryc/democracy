Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and complaining like a kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
