Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
