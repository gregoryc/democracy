Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
