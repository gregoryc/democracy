Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
