Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
