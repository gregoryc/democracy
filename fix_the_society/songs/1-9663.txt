Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
