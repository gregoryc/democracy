Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too insidious for many to detect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
