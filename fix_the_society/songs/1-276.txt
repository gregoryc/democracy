Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
