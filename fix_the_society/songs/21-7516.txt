Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
