Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
