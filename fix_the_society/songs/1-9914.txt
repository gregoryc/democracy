Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
