Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
