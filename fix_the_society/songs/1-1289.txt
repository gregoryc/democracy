Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
