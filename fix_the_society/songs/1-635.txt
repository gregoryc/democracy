Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
