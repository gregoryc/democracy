Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
