Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
