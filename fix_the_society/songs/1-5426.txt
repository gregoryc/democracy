Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
