Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
