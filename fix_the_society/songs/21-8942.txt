Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
