Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
