VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
