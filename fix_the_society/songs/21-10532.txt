Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
