Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
