Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
