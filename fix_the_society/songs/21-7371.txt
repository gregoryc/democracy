Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
