Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
