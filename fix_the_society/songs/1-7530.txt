Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
