Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
