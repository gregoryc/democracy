Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
