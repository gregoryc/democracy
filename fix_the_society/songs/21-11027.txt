Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
