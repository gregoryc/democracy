Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
