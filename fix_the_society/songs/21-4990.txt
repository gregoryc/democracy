Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
