Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
