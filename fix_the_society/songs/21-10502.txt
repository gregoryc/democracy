Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
