Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
