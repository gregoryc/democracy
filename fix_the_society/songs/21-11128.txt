Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
