Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
