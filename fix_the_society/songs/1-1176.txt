Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
