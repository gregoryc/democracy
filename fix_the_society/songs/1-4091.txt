Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Playing only the worst card
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
