Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
