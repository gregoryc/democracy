Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
