Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
