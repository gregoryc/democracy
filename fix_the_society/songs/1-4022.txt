Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
