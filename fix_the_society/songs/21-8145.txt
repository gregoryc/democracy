Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
