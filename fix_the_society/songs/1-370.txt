Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
