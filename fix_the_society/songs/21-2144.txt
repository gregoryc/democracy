Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
