Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
