Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
