Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
