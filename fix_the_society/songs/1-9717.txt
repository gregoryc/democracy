Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
