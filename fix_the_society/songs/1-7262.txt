Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
