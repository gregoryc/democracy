Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
