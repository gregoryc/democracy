Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
