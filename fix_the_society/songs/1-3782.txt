Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
