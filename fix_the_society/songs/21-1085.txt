Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
