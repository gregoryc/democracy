Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
