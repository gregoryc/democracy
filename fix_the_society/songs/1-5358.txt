Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
