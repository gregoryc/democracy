Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
