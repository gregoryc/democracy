Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
