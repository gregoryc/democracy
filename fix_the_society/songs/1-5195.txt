Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
