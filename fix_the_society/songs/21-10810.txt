Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
