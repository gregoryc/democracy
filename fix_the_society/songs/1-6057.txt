Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
