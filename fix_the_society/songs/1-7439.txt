Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
