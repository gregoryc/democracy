Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
