Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
