Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
