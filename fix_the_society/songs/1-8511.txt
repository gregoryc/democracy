Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
