Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
