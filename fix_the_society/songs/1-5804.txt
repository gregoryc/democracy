Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
