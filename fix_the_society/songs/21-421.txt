Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
