Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
