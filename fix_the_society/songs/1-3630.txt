Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
