Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
