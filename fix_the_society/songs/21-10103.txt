Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
