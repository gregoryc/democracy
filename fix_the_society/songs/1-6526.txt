Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
