Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
