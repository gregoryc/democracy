Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
