Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Reason is what they want to discard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
