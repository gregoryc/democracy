Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
