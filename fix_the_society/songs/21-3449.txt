Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
