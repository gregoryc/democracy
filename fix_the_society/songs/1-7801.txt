VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
