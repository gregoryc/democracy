Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
