Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
