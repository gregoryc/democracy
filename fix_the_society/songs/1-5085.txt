Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
