Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
