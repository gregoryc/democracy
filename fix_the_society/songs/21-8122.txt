Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
