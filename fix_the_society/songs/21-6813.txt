Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
