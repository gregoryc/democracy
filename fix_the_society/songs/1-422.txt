Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
