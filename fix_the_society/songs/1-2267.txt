Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
