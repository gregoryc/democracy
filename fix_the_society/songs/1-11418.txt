Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
