Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
