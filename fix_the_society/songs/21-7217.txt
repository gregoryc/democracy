Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
