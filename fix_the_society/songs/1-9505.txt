Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
