Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
