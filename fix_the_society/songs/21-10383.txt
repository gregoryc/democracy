Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
