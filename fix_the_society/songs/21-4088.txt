Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
