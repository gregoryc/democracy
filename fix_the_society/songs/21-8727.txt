Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
