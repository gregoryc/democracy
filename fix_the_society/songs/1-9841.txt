Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
