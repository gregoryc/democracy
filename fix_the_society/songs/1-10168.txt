Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
