Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
