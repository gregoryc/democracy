Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
