Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
