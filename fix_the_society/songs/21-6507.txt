Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
