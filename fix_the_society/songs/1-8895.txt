Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
