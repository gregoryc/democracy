Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
