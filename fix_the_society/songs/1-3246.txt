Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
