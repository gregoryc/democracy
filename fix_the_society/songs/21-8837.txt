Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
