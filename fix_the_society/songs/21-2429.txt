Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
