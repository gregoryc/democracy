Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
