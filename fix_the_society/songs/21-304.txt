Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
