Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
I must speak here, I must interject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
