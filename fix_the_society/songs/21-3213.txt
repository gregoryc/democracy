Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
