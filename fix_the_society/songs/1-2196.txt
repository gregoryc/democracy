Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
