VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
