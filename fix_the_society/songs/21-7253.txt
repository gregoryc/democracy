Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
