Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
