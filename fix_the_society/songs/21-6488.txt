Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
