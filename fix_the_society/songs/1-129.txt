Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
