Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
