Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
