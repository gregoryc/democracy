Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
