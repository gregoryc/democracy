Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
