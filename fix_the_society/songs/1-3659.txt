Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
