Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
