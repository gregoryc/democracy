Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
