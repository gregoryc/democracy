Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
