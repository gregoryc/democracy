VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
