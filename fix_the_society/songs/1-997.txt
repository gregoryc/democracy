Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
