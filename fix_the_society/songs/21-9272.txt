Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
