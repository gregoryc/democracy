Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
