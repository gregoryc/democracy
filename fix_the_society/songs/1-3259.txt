Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
