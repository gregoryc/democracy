Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
