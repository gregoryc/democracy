Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
