VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
