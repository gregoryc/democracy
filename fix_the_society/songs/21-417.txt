Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
