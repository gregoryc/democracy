Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
