Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
