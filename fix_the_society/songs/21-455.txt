Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
