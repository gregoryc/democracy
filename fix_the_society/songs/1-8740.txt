Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
I must speak here, I must interject

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
