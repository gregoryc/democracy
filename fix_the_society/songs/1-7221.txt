Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
