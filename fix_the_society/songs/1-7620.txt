Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
