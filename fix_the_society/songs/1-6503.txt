Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
