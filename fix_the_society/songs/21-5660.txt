Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
