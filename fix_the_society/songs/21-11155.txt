Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
