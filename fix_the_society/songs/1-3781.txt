VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
