Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
