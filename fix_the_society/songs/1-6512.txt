VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
