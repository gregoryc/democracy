Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
