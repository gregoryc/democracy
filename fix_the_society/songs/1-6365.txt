Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
