Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
