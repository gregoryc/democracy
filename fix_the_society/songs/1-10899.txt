Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
