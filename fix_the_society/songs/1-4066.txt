Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
