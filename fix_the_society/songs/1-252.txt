Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
