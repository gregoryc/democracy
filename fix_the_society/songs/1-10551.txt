Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
