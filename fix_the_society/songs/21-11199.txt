Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
