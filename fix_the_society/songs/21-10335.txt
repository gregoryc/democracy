Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
