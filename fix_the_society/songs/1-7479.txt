Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
I must speak here, I must interject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
