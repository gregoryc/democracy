Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
