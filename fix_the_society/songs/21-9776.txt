Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
