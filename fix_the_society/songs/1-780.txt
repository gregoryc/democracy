Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
