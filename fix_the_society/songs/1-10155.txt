VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS
