VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
