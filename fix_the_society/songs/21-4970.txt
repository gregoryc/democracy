Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
