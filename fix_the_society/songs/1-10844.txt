VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
