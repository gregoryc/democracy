Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
