Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
