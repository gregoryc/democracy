Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
