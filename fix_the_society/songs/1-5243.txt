Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
