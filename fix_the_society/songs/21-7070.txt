Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
