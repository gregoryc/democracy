Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
