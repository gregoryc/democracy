Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
