Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
