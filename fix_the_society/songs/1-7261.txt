Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
