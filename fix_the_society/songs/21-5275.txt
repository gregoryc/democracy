Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
