Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
