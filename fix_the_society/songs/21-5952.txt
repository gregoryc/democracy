Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
