Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
