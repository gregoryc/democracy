Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
