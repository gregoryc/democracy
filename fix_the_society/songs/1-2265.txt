Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
