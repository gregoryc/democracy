Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
