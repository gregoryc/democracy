Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
