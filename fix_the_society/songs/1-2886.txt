Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
