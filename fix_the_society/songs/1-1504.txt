Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
