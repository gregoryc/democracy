Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
