Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
