Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
