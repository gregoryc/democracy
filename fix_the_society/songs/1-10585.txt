Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
