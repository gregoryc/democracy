Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
