Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
