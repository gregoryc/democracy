Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
