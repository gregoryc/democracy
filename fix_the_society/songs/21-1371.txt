Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
