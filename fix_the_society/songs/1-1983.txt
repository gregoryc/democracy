Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
