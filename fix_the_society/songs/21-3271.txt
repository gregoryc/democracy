Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
