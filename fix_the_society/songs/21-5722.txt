Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
