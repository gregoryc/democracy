Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
