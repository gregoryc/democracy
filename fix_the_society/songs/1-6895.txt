Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

I must speak here, I must interject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
