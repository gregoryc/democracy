Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
