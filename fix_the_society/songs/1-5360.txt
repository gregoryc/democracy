VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This is plain, anyone can detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
