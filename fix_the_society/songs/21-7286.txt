Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
