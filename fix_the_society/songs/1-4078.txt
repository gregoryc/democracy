Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
