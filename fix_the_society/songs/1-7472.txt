Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
