Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
