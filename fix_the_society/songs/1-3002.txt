VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

I must speak here, I must interject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
