Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
