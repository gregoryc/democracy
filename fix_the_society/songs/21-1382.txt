Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
