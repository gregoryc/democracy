Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
