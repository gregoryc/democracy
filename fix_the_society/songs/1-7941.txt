Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
