Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
