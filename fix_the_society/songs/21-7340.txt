Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
