Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
