Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
