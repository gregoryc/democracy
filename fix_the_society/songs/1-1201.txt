Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
