Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
