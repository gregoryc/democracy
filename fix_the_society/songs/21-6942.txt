Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
