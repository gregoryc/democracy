Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
