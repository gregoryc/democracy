Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
