Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
