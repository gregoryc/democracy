Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
