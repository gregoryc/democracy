VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and crying like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
