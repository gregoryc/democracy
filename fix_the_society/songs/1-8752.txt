Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
