Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
