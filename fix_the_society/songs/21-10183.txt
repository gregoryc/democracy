Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
