Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
