Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
