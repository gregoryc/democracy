Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
