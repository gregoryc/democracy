Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and crying like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and crying like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and crying like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and crying like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
