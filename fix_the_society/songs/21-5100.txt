Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
