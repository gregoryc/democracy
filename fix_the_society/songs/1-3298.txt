Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
