Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
