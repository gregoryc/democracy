Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
