Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
