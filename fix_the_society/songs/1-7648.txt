Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
