Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
