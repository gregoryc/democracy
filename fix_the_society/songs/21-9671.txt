Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
