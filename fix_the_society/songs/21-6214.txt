Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
