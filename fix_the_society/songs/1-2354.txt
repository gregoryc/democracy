Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
