Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
