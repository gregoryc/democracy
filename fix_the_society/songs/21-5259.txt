Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
