Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
