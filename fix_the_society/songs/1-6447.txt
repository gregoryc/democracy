Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
