Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
