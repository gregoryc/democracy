Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
