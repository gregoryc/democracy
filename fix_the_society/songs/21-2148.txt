Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
