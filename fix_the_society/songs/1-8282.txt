Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
