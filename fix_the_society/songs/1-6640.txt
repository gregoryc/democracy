Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
