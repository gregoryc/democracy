Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
