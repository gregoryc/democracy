Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
