Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
