Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
