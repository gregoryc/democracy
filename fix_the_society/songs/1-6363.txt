Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
