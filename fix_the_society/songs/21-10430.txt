Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
