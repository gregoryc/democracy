Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
