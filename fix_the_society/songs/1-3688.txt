Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
