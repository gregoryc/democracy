Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
