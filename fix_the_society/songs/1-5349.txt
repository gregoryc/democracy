Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
