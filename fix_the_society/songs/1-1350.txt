Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

I must speak here, I must interject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
