Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
