Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
