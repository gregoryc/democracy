Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
