Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
