Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
