VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
