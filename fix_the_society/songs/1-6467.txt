Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
