Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
