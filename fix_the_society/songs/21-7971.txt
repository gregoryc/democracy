Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
