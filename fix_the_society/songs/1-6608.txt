Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
