Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
