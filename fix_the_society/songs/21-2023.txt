Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
