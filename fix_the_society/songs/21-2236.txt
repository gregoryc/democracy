Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
