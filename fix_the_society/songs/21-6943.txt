Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
