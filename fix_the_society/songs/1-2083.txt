Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
