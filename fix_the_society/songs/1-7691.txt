Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
