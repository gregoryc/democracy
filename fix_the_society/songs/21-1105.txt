Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
