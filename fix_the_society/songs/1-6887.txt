Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
