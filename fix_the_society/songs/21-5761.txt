Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
