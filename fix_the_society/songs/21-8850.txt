Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
