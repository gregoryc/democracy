Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
