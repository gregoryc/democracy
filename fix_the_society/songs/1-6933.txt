Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
