Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
