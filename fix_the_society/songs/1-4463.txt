Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and crying like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
