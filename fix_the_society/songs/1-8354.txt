Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
