Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
