Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
