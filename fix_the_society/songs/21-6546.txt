Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
