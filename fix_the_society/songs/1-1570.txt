Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
