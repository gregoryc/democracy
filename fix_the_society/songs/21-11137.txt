Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
