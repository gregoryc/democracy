Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
