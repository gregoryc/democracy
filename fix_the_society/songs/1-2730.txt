Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
