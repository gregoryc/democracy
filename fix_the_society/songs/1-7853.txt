Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
