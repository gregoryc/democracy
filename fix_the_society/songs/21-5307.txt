Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
