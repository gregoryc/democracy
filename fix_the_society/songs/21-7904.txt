Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
