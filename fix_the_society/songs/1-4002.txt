Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
