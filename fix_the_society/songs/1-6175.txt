Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
