Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
