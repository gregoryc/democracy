Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
