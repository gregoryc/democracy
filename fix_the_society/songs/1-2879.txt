Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is  fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
