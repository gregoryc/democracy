Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
