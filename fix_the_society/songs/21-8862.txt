Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
