Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

CHORUS

They hate themselves, they do not respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They hate themselves, they do not respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
