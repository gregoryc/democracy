Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
