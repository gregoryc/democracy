Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
