Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
