VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
