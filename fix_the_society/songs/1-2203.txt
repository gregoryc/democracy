Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
