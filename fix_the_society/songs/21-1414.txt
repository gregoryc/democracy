Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
