Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
