Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Not talking isn't going to divert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Not talking isn't going to divert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Not talking isn't going to divert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
