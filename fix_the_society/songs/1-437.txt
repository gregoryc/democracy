Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
