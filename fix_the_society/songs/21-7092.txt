Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
