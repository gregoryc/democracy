Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
