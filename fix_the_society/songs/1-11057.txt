Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
