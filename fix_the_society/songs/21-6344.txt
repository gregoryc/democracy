Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
