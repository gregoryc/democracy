Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
