Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
