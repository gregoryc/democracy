Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
