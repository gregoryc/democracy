Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
