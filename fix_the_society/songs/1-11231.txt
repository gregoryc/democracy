Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
