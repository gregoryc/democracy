Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
