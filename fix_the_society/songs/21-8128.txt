Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
