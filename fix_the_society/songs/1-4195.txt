VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and moaning like a kid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
