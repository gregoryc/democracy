Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
