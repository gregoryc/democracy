Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
