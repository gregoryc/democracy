Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
