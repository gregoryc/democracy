Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
