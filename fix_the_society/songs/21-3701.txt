Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
