Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
