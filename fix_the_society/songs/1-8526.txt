Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
