Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
