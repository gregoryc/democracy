Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
