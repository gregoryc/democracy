Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
