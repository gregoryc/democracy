Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
