Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
