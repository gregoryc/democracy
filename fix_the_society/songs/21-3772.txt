Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
