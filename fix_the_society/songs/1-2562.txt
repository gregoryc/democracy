VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
