Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
