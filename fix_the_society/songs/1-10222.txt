Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
