Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
