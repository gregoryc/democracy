Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
