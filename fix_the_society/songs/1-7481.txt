Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
