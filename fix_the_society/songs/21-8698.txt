Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
