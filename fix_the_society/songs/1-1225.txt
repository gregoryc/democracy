Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Science is  fundamentally inert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too insidious for many to detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They do junk, they do dirt
