Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
