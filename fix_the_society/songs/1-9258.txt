Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
