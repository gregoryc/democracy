Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
