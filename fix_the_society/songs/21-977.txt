Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
