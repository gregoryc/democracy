Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
