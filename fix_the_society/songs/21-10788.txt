Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
