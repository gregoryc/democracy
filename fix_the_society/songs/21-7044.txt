Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
