Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
