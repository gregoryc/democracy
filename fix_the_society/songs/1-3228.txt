Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
