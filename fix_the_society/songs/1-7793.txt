Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
