Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
