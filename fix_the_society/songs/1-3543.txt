Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
