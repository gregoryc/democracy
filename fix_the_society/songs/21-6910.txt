Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
