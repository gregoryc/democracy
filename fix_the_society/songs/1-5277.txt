Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
