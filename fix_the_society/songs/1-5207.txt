Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
