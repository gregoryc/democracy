Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
