Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
No one will be unhurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
