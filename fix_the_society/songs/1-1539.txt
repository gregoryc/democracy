Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too insidious for many to detect

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
