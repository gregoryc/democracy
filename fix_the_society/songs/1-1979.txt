Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
