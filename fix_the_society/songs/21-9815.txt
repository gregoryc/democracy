Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
