VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
