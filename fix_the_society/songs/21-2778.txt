Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
