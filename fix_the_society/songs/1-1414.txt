Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
