Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
