Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and moaning like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Science is  fundamentally inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
