Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
