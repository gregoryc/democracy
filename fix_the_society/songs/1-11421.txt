VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
