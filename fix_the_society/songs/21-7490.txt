Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
