Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
