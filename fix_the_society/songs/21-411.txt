Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
