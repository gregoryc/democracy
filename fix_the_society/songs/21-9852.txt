Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
