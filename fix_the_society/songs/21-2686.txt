Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
