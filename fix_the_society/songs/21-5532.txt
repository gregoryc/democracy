Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
