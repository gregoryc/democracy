Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
