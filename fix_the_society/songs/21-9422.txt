Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
