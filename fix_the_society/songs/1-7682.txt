Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
