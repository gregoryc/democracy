VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
