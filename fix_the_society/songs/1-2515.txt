Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
