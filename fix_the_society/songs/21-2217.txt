Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
