Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and crying like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
