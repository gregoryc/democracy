Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
