Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
