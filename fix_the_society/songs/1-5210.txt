Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
