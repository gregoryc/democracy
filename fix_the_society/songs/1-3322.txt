Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
