Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
