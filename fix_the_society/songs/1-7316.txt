Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
