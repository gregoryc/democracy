Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
