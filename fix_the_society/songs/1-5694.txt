Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
