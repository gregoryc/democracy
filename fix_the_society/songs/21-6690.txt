Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
