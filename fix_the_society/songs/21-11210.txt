Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
