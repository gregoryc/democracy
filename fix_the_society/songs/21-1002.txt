Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
