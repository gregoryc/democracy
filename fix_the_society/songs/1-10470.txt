Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
