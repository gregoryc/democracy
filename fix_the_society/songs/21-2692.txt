Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
