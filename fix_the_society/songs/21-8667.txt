Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
