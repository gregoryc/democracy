Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
