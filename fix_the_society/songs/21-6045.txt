Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
