Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
