Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
