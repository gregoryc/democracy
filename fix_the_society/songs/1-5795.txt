Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
