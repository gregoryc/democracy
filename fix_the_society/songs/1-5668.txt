Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
