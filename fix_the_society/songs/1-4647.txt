Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
