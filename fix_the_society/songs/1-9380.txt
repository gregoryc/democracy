VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
