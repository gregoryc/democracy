Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
