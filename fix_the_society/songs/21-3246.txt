Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
