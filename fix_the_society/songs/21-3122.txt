Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
