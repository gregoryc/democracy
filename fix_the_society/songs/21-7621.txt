Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
