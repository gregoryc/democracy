Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
