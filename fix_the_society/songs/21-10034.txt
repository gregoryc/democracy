Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
