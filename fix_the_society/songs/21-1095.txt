Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
