Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
