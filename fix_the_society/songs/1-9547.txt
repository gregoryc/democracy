Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
