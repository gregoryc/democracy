Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
