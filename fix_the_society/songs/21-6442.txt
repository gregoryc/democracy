Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
