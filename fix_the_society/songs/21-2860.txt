Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
