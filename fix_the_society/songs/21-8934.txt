Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
