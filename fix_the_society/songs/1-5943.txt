Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
