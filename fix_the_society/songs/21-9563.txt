Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
