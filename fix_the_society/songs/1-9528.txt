Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
