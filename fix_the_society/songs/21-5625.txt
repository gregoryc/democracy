Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
