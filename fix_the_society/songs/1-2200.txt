Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and crying like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
