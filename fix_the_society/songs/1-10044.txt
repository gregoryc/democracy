Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
