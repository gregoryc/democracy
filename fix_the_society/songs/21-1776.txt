Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
