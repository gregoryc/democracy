Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
