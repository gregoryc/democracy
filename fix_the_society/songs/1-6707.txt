Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
