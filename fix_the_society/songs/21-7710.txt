Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
