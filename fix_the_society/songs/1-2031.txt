Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
