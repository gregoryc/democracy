Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Whining and crying like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
