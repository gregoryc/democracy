Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
