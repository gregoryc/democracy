Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid

This is wholesale, in every aspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
