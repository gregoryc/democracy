Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
