Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
