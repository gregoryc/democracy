Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
