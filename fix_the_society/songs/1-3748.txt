Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
