Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
