Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
