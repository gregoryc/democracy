Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
