Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
