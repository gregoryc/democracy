Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
