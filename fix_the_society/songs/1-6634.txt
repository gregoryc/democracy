VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
