Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
