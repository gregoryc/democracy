Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
