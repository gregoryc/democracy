Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
