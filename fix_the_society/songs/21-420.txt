Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
