Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
