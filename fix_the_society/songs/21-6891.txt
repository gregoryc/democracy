Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
