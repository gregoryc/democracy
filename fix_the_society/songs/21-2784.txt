Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
