Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
