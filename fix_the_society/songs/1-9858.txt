Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
