Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
