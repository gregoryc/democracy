Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
