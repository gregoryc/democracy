Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
