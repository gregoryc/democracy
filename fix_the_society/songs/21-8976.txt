Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
