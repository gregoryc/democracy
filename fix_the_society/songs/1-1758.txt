Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
