Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
