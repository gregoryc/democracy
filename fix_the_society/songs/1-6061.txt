VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
