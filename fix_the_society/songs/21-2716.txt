Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
