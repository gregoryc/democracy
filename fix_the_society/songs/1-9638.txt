Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
