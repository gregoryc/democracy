Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
