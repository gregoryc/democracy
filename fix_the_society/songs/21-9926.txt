Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
