Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
