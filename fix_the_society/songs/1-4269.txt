Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
