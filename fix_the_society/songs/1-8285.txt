Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, they act like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
