Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
