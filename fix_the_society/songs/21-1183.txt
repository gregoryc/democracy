Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
