Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
