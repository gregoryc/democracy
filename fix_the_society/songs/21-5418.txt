Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
