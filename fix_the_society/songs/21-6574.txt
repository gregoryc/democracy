Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
