Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
