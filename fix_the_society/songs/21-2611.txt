Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
