Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
