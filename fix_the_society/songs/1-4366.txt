Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS
