Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
