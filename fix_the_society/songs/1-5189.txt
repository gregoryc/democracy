Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
