Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
