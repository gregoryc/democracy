Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
