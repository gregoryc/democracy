Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
