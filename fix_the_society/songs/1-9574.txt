VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
