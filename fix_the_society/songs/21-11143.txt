Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
