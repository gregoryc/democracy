Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
