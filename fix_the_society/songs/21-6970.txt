Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
