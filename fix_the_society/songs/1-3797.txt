Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
