Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
