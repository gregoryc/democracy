Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
