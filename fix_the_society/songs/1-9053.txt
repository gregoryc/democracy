Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
