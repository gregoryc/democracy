Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
