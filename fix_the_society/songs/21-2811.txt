Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
