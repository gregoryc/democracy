Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
