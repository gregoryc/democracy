Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
