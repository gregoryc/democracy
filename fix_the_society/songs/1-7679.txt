Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
