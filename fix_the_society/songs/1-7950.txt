Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
