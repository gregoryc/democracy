Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
