Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
