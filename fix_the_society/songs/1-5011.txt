Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
