Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
