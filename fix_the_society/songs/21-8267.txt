Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
