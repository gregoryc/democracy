Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
