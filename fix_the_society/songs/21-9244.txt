Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
