Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
