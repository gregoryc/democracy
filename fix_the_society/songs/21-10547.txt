Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
