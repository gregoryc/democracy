Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
