Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
