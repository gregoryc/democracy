VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
