Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
