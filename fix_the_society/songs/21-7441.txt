Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
