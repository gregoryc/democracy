VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
