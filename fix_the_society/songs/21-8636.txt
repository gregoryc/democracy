Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
