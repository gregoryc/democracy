Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
