Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
