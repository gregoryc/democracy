Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
