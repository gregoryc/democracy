Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
