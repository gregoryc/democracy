Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
