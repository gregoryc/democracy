Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
