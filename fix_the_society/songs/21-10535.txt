Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
