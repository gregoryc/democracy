Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
