Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
