Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
