Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
