Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
