Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
