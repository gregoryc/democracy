Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
