Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
