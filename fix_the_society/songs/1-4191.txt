VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
