Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
