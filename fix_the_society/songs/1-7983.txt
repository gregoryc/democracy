Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
