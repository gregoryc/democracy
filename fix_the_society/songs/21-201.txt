Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
