Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
