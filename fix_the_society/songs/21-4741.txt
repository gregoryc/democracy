Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
