Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
