Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

An open conversation, they always divert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
