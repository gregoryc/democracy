Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
