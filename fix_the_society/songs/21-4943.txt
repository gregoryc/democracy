Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
