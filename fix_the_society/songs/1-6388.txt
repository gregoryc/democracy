Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
