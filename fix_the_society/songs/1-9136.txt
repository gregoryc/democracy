Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
