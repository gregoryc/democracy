Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
