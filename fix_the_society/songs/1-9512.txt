Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They hate themselves, they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They hate themselves, they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
