Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
