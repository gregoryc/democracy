Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
