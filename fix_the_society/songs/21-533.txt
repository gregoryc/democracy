Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
