Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
