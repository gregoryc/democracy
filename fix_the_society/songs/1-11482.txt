Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and moaning like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and moaning like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and moaning like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
