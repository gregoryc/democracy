Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
