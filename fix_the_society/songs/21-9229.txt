Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
