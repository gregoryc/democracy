Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
