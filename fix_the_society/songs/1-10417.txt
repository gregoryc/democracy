Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
