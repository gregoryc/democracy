Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They do junk, they do dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They hate themselves, they do not respect

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
