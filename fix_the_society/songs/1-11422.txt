Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
