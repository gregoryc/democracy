Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
