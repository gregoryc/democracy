Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
