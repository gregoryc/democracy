Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
