Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
