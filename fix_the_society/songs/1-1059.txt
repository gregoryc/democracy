Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
