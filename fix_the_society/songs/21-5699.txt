Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
