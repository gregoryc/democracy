Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
