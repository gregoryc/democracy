Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
