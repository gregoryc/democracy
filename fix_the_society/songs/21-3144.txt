Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
