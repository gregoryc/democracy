Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
