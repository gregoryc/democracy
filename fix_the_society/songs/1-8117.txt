Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
