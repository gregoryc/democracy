Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
