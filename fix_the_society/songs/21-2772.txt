Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
