Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
