Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
