Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
