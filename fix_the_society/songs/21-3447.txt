Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
