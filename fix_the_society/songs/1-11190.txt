Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
