Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Science is  fundamentally inert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
