Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
