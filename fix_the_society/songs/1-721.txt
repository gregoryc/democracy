Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
