Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

If you talk to them they miss the subject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

If you talk to them they miss the subject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
