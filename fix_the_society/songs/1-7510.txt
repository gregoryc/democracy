Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
An open conversation, they always divert

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
