Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
