Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
