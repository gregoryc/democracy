Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
