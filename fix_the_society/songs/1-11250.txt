Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
