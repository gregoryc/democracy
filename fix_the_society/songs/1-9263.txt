Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
