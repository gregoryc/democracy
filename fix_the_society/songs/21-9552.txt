Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
