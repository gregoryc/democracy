Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Whining and moaning like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Whining and moaning like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
