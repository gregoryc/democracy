Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
