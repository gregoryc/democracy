Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
