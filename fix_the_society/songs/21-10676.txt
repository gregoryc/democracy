Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
