Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
