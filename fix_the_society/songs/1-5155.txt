Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
