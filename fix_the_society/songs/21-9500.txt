Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
