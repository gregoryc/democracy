Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
