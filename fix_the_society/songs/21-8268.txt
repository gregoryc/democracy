Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
