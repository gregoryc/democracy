Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
