Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
