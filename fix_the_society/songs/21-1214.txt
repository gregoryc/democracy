Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
