Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
