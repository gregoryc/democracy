Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
