Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
