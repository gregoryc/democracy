Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

You don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
