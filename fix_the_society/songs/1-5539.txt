Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
