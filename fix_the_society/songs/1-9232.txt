Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
