Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
