VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
