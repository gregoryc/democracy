Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
