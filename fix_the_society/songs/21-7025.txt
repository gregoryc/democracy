Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
