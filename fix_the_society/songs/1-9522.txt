Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
