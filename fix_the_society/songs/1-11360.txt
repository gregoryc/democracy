Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
