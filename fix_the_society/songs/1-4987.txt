Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
