Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
