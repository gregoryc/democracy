Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
