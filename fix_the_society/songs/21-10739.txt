Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
