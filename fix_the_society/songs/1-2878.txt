Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
