Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
