VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
