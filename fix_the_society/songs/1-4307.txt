Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
