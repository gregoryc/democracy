Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
