Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
