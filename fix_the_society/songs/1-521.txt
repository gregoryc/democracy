Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is obvious, anyone can detect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
