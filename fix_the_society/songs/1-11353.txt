Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
