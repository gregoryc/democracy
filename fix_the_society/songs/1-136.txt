Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
