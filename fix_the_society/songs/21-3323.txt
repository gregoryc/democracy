Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
