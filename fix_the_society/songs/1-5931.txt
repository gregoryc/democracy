Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The society itself, you completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
