Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
