Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
