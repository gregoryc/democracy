Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
