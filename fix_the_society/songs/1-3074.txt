Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
