Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
