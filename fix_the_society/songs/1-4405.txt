Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
