Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
