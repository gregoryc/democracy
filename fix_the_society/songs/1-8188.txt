Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
