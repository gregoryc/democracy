Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
