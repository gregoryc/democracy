Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
