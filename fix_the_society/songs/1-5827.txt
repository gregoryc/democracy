Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
