Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
