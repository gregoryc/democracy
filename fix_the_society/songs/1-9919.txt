Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and complaining like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
