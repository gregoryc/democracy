Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too insidious for many to detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too insidious for many to detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
