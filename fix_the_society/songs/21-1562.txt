Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
