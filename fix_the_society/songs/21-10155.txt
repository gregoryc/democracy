Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
