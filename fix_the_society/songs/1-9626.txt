Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Evading conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
