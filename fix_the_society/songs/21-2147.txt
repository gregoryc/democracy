Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
