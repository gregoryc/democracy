Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
