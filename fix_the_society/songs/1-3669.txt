Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
