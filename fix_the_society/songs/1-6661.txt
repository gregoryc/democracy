Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
