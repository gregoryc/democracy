Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
