Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
