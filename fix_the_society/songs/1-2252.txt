Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
