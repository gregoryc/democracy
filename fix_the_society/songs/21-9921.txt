Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
