Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
