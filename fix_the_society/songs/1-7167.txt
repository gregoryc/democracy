Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
