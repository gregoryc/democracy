Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
