Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
