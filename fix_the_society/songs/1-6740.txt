Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
