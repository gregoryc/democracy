VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
