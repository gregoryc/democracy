Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
