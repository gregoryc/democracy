Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
