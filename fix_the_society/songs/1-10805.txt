Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
