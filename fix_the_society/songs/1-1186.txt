Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and crying like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
