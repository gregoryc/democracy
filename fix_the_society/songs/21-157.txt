Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
