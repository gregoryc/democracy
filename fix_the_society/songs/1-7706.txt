Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
