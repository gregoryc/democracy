Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
