Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
