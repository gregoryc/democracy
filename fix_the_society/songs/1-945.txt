Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
