Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
