Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
