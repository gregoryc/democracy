Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
