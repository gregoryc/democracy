Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
