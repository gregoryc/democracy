Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
