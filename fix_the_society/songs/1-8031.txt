Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
