Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
