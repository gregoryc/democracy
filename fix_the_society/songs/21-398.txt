Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
