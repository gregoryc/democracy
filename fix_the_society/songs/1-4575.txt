Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
