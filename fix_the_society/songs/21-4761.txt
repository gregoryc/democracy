Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
