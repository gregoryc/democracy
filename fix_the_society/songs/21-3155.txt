Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
