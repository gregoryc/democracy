Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
