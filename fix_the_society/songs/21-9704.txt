Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
