Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
