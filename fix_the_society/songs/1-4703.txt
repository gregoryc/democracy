Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Stop this already, time to get rid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
