Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
