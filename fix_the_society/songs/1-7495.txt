Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
