Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
