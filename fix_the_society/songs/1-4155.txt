Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
