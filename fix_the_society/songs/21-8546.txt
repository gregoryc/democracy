Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
