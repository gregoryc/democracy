Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
