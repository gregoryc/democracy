Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
