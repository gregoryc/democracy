Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
