Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
