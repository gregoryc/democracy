Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
