Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
