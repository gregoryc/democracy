Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
