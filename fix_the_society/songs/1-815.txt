Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
