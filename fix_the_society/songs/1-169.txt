Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
