Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
