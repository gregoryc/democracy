Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
