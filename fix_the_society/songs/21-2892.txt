Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
