Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
