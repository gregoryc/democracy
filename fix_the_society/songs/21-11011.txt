Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
