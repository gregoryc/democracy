Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
