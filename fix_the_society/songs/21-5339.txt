Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
