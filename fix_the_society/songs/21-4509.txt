Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
