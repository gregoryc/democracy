Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
