Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
