Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
