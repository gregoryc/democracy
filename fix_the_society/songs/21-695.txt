Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
