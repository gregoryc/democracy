Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
