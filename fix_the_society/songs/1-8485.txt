Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
