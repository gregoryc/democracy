Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
