Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
