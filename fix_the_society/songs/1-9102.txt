Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
