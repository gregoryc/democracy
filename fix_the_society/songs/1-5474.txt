Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
