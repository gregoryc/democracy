Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
