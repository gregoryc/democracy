Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
