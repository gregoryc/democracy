Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
