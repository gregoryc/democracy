Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too insidious for many to detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
