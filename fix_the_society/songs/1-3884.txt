Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
