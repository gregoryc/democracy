Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
