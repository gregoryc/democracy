Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
