Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
