Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
