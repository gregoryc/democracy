Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

This is too insidious for many to detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
