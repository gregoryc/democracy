Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
