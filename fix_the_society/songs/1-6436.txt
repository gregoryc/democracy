Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
