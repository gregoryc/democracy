Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
