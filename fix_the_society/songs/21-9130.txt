Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
