Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
