Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
