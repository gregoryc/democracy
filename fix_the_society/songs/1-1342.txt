Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
