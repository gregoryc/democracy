Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
