Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
