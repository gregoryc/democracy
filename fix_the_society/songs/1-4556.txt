Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
I must speak here, I must interject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
