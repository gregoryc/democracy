Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
