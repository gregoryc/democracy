Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
