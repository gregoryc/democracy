Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
