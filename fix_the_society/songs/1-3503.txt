Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
