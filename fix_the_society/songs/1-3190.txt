Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
