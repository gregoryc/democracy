Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
