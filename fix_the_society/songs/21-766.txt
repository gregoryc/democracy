Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
