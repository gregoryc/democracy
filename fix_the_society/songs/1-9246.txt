VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
