Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
