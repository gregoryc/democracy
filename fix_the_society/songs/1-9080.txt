Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
