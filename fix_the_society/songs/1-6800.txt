Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
