Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
