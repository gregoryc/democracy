Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
