Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
