Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

You don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
