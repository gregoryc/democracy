Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
