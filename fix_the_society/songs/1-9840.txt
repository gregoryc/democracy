Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
