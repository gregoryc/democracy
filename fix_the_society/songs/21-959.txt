Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
