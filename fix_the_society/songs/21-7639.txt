Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
