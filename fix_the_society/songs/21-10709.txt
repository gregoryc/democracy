Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
