VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
