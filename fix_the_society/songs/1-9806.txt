VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
