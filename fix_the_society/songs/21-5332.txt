Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
