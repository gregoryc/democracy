Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
