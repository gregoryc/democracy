Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

I must speak here, I must interject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
