Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
