Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
