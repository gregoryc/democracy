Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
