Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
