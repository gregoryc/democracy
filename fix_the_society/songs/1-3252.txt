Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
