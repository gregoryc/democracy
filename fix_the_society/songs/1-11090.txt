Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
