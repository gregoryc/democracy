Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
