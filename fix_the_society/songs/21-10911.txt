Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
