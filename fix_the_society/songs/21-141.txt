Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
