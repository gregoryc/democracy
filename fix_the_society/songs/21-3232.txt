Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
