Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
