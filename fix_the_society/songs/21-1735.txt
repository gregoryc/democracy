Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
