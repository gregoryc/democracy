Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while acting like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
