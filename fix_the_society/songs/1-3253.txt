Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is  fundamentally inert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
