Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
