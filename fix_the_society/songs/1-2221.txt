Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
