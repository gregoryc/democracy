VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
