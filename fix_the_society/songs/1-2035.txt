Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
