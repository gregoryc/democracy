Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
