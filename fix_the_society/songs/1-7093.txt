Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
