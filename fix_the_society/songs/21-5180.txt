Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
