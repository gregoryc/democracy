Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
