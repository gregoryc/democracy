Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
