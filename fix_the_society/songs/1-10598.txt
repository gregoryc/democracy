VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
