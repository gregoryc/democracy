Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
