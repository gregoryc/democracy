Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
