Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
