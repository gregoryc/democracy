VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Playing only the worst card
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
