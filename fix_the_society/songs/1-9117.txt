Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
