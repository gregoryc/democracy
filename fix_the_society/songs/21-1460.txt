Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
