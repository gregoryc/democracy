Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
