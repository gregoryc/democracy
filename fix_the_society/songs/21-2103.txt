Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
