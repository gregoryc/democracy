Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
