Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
