Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
