Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
