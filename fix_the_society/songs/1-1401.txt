Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
