Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and moaning like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and moaning like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
