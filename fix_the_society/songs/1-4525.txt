Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
