Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
