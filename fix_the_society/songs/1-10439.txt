Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
