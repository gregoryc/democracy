Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
