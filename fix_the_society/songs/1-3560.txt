Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
