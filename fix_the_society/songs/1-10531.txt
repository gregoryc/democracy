Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
