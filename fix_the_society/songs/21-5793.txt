Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
