Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
