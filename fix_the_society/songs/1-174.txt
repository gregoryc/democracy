VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
