Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
