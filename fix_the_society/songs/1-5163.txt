Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
