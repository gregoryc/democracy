Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
