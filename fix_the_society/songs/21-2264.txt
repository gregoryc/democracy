Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
