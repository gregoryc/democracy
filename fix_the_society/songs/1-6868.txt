Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
