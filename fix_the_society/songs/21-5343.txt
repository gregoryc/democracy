Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
