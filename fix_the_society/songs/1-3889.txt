Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
