Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
