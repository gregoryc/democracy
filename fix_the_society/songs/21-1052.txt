Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
