Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is plain, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
