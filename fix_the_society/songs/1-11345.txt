Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
