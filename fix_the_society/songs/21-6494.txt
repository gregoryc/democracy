Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
