Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
