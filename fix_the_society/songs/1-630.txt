Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is too insidious for many to detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is too insidious for many to detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is too insidious for many to detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
