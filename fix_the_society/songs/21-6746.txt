Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
