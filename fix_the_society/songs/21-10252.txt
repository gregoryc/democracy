Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
