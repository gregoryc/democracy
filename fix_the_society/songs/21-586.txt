Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
