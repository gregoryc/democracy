Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
