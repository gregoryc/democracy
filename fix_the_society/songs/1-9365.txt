Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
