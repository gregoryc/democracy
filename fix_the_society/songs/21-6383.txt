Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
