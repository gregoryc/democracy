Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
