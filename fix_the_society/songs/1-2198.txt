Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and complaining like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
