Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and moaning like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

The state of science is, wholly inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
