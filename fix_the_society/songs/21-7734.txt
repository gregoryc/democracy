Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
