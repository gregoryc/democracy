Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
