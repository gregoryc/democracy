Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
