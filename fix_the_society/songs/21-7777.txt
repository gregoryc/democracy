Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
