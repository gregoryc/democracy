VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is too insidious for many to detect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
