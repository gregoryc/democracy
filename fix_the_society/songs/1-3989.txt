Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
