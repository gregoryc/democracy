Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
