Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
