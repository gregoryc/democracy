Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
