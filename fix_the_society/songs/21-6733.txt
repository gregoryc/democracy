Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
