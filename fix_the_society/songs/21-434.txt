Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
