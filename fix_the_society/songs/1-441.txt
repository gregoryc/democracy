Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
