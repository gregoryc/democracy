Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
