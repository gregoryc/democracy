Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
