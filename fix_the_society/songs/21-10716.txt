Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
