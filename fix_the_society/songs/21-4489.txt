Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
