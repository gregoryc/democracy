Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
