Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
