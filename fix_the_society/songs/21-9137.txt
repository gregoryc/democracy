Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
