Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
