Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
