Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
