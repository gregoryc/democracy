Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
