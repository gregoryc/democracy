Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
