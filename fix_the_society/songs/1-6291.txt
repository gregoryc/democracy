VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
