Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
