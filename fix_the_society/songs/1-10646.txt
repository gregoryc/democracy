Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
