Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
