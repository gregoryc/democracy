Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
