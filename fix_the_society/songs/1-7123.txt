Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
