Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
