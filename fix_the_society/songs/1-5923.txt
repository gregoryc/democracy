Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
