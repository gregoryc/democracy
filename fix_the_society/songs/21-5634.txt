Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
