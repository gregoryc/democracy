VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
