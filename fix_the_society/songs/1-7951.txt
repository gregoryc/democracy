Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
