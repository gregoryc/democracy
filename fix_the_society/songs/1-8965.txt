VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
