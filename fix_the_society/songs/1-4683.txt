Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
