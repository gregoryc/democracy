Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
