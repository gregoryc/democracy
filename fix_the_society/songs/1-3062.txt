Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
