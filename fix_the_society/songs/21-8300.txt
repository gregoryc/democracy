Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
