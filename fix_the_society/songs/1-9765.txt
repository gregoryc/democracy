VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
