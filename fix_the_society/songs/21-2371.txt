Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
