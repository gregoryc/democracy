Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
