Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
