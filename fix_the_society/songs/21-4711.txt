Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
