Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
