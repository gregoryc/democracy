Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
