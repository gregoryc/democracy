VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too insidious for many to detect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
