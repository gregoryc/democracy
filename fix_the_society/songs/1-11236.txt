Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
