Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
