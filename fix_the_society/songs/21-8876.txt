Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
