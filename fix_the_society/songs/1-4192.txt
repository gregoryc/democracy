Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
