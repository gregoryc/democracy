Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
