Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
