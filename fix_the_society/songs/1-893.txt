VERSE

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
