Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
