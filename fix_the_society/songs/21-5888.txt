Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
