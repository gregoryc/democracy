Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
