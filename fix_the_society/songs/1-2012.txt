Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
