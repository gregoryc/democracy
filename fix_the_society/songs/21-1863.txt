Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
