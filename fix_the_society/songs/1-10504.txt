Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, they act like a kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
