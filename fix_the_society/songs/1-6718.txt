Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
