Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
