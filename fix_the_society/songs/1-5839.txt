Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
