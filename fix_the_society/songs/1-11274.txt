Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
