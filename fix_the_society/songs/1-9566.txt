Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
