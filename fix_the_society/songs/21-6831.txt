Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
