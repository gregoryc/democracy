Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
