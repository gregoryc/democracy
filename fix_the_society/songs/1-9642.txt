Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
