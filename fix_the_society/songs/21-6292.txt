Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
