Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
