Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
