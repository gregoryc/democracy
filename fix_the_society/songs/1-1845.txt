Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
