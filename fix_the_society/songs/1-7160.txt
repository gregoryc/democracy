Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
