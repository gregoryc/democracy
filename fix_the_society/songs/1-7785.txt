Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
