Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their own principles are something they do not respect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
