Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
