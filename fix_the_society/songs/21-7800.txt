Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
