Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
