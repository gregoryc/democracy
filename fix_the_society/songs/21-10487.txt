Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
