Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
