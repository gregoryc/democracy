Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
