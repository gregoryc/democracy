Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
