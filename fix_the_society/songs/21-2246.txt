Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
