Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
