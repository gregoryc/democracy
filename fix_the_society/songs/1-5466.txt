VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
